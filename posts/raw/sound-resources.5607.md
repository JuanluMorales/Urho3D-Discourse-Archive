it may seem like a "kind of waste of time" topic, but as this is an active and friendly community I came to ask: does anyone here know a good place for "MIDI, Samples, and VSTs" resources?

preferably something like rhythmic apocalyptic "gregorian choir" like this:

(0:00 ~ 0:45) && (0:55 ~ 1:30)

(i know that the choir part is very hard, someone else singing, but it doesn't hurt to ask)

Besides searching on Google, it's a question best asked on forums of music composition software such as LMMS (https://lmms.io/forum/), etc.
