SirNate. I kind of guessed and feel slightly embarrassed I didn’t look that up. However, while I’ve got you on the line as it were, do you think animating a single bone would be much more expensive than the corresponding manual operations, eg. get position/rotational data from other bones and then use to position and rotate the single bone?

It’s probably about the same cost as doing it all “manually”. Unless you are doing thousands of these, the performance probably doesn’t matter either way. Unless you have good reason to believe this will be the performance bottleneck, just get it done first however and optimize it later if it is in fact an issue.
