To pass some time, I decided to create a basic twin-stick shooter demo. This is incomplete, but was not intended to be completed. This was a training exercise more than an actual attempt at a game, which was to practice using components to drive game logic. I also learned a lot about Navigation, Particles, and other Urho3D subsystems that I had not had a chance to delve into before.

You can find the repo here: [github.com/thebluefish/Prime](https://github.com/thebluefish/Prime)

This also relies on this Urho3D fork: [github.com/JSandusky/Urho3D/tre ... CacheCrowd](https://github.com/JSandusky/Urho3D/tree/JS-DetourCacheCrowd)

It is otherwise perfectly capable of compiling with the latest branch of Urho3D if you remove the missing component references.

To run, open the in-game editor, and load the Scene "Test.xml". /Data/Objects/ holds Bullet.xml and Enemy.xml to facilitate easy creation of those objects.
