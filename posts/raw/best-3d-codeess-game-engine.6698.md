There is no such thing. But that depends on your definition of *codeless free*.

Sure, one probably exists. But definitely not free and not what you imagine. I remember [gamemaker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) featured a "code free" mode for simple hello world games. But that was years ago. Don't know how that holds up now.

[Maybe](https://scratch.mit.edu/)  or [maybe](http://stencyl.com/) or [maybe](https://www.construct.net/en) or [maybe](https://gdevelop-app.com/) etc.

Either way, they all involve some form of programming tho. You just don't see it.

Maybe learn some? Like... learning to walk before running?
