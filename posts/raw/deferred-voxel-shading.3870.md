Has anyone heard of this particular technique for shading?

I've recently stumbled upon it and was thinking it may be a viable solution for GI in Urho that is supported for OpenGL and DirectX (perhaps?). Not sure when I would be able to get around to porting it, although if anyone else has time I think it would be worth it. :slight_smile:

It might also help to use CodeMonkey's Geometry Shaders for Urho3D.
