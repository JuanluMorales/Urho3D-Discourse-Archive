While probably not as great for performance as creating a 3D geometry visualization, my idea so far is rather simple: just generate an Urho3D::Image for each pie share and stack them on top of each other in the UI as BorderImages (same position and resolution).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy problem arises from the fact that I want every share to have a separate tooltip\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow as far as I can see it there is no option to have transparent parts of the image \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e trigger tooltips (i.e. like a view mask), so as it is it would always show the tooltip of the last element.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre there any parameters that I overlooked, to change that behaviour without going into the engine source code? Or a better way to do this that is not too much effort? Perhaps someone already made custom UIElements that go into the direction of being more interactive, e.g. for displaying graphs or other charts?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks!\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-08T23:36:17.980Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":35,"readers_count":34,"score":7.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":6609,"topic_slug":"creating-pie-charts-for-the-ui","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1317,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":41188,"name":"evol","username":"evolgames","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/evolgames/{size}/3169_2.png","created_at":"2020-12-09T03:50:46.843Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eSo the image’s transparent sections are overlapping the ones underneath and messing up your tooltip hover? That’s what I understood here.\u003cbr\u003e\nCare to post a pic? Why are you using images for pie chart sections?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I were you I would do sprites to build the pie charts and use raycasts on them. Shouldn’t be that hard to manipulate 1x1 pixel white image squares into what you need via scale and color. Then (by node name) you can easily grab what section was hovered over with a raycast. Custom UI would be better and more elegant but that’s what I would do and I can confirm it would work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso I guess depends what kind of precision youre doing with the chart. If 1%, for example, is the smallest unit (no decimals, or you will round down in visual representation) then you can just make a 1% sliver sprite and clone it 99 times with the correct colors and names.
