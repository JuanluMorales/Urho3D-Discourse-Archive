All included samples run well without issue, both the C++ executable and the script files. But I encountered a problem while trying to use physics in the Editor.\u003cbr\u003e\nOn opening the Editor, I created a simple plane from the included plane model, scaled it considerably, added a rigid body and a static plane collision shape. Next I added a box with a rigid body with a mass of 1.0 and a box collision shape. This box was raised up so as to fall on the plane when the RunUpdatePlay button is pressed. Now when the RunUpdatePlay button is pressed, the box falls, but when it makes contact with the plane, the Urho3DPlayer crashes, but if the box’s rigid body mass is set to 0.0 and the scene played, there is no crash.\u003cbr\u003e\nI even tried opening the scene I saved from the Sample physics test that comes with urho3D, but as I play the scene Urho3DPlayer equally crashes. Why i believe this is a MinGW-w64 problem is the fact that I already have and use a Visual C++ build of Urho3D, and non of these crashes occur. I even tried loading the scene from the Sample physics test with the same Editor script but run by the two different build of Urho3DPlayer, but that built with MinGW-w64 still crashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow is my MinGW-w64 version info\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003eUsing built-in specs.\nCOLLECT_GCC=g++\nCOLLECT_LTO_WRAPPER=C:/MinGW-w64/mingw32/bin/../libexec/gcc/i686-w64-mingw32/4.9.1/lto-wrapper.exe\nTarget: i686-w64-mingw32\nConfigured with: ../../../src/gcc-4.9.1/configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --build=i686-w64-mingw32 --target=i686-w64-mingw32 --prefix=/mingw32 --with-sysroot=/c/mingw491/i686-491-posix-dwarf-rt_v3-rev0/mingw32 --with-gxx-include-dir=/mingw32/i686-w64-mingw32/include/c++ --enable-shared --enable-static --disable-multilib --enable-languages=ada,c,c++,fortran,objc,obj-c++,lto --enable-libstdcxx-time=yes --enable-threads=posix --enable-libgomp --enable-libatomic --enable-lto --enable-graphite --enable-checking=release --enable-fully-dynamic-string --enable-version-specific-runtime-libs --disable-sjlj-exceptions --with-dwarf2 --disable-isl-version-check --disable-cloog-version-check --disable-libstdcxx-pch --disable-libstdcxx-debug --enable-bootstrap --disable-rpath --disable-win32-registry --disable-nls --disable-werror --disable-symvers --with-gnu-as --with-gnu-ld --with-arch=i686 --with-tune=generic --with-libiconv --with-system-zlib --with-gmp=/c/mingw491/prerequisites/i686-w64-mingw32-static --with-mpfr=/c/mingw491/prerequisites/i686-w64-mingw32-static --with-mpc=/c/mingw491/prerequisites/i686-w64-mingw32-static --with-isl=/c/mingw491/prerequisites/i686-w64-mingw32-static --with-cloog=/c/mingw491/prerequisites/i686-w64-mingw32-static --enable-cloog-backend=isl --with-pkgversion='i686-posix-dwarf-rev0, Built by MinGW-W64 project' --with-bugurl=http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64 CFLAGS='-O2 -pipe -I/c/mingw491/i686-491-posix-dwarf-rt_v3-rev0/mingw32/opt/include -I/c/mingw491/prerequisites/i686-zlib-static/include -I/c/mingw491/prerequisites/i686-w64-mingw32-static/include' CXXFLAGS='-O2 -pipe -I/c/mingw491/i686-491-posix-dwarf-rt_v3-rev0/mingw32/opt/include -I/c/mingw491/prerequisites/i686-zlib-static/include -I/c/mingw491/prerequisites/i686-w64-mingw32-static/include' CPPFLAGS= LDFLAGS='-pipe -L/c/mingw491/i686-491-posix-dwarf-rt_v3-rev0/mingw32/opt/lib -L/c/mingw491/prerequisites/i686-zlib-static/lib -L/c/mingw491/prerequisites/i686-w64-mingw32-static/lib'\nThread model: posix\ngcc version 4.9.1 (i686-posix-dwarf-rev0, Built by MinGW-W64 project) \n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no idea what might be wrong here\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T00:59:56.378Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":12,"reads":4,"readers_count":3,"score":60.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":373,"topic_slug":"solved-editor-crash-on-physics-with-mingw","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":94,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":1983,"name":"Lasse Öörni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2014-08-02T11:01:53.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eCrash reproduced when I load the scene saved from the Physics sample in the editor, and start scene update (Ctrl-P).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEDIT: the crash happens inside Bullet’s box-box collision detection routine, where it’s using SSE math instructions.
