Is this thing serious?

What would be the criteria of *serious*?

Well basically they sold everything off...
What a shame, didn't know that... would've surely bought pong or battlezone for my private library... :face_with_monocle: :face_with_monocle:

Apparently the VCS is part of their _[turnaround strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari,_SA#Turnaround_strategy)_ as indeed they seem to have [lost some limbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari,_SA#Bankruptcy).
But that could also mean they refused to P2W/pre-release-DLC/paywall their own franchises. Also I'm surprised anyone wanted to pay for all those 90s game titles. I mean how do you value...

When I read that I thought it could be interesting to have the engine ready for that *platform*. But looks nothing less than a Linux in a x86_64... So in theory already is.

But contacting them, and ensuring the fact... And maybe get a post from them including urho3d as a supported engine... could it be an interesting boost for us?
