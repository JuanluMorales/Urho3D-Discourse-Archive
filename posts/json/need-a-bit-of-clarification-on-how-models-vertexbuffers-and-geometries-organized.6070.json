Each Geometry also stores a list of Vertex/Index buffers, to be used at a given LOD and with a given material (I believe the different Geometries within a given Model each get their own material in StaticModel). When saving, rather than having duplicate buffers, the index in the “complete” list is used, but in general within the engine only the specific entries for a given Geometry are used at one time, and by having multiple pointers to it rather than an index into the global list performance is likely increased a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems to me that we should either do as you suggest, add some comments in the Geomtry API that each buffer should also be added to the Model, or add an additional parameter to \u003ccode\u003ebool SetGeometry(unsigned index, unsigned lodLevel, Geometry* geometry);\u003c/code\u003e along the lines of \u003ccode\u003ebool addNewBuffers = false\u003c/code\u003e that will add the Vertex/Index Buffers to the Model from their pointers in the Geometry if they are not already present in the Model’s vector’s.
