Is it during CMake configuration/generation stage? Or the build tree already got generated and error during actual build phase. I can only assume it is the former, since only CMake does popup error message thingy. If so, then your issue sounds like your project has outdated CMake modules from Urho3D project. Probably you have not setup mklink nor symlink when you created the initial structure of your project the first time, so your project only contains soft copies of the CMake modules at that time. And if so then do yourself a favor by learning how to use mklink or symlink properly and setup your project to use it and fix the problem once and for all. You can, of course,  just try to refresh your stale/outdated CMake modules (and toolchains) by simply making another hard copy operation. However, you have to remember to keep doing that frequently for the remaining of your project’s life. Then again, I could be totally wrong about it because all these is just based on my assumption of what has happened.
