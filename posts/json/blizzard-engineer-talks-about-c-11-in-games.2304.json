At least not in 2016. He basically (\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003ealmost\u003c/span\u003e) lost me at the std::distance thing. To me it seems like someone who’s been using the basics of C++ (\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003emore like C with classes\u003c/span\u003e) and then just heard of C++11 and thought he knows enough to tell people that yea, this is the bomb. Most of what he talked about can be found in documentation websites such as \u003ca href=\"http://cppreference.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ecppreference.com\u003c/a\u003e. He barely even touched the good stuff. Most of what he covered can probably be found in something like an overview page of the C++11 features. Or a 10 minute 101 course. Nothing really critical to game engines was presented (\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003eIMO\u003c/span\u003e). Like some revolutionary thing that no one didn’t knew until now. And in my opinion C++11 was more like an experiment which was pimped a little in C++14 and finally done right in C++17.

They’ve delivered compilers with half implementations of the C++y features and then incrementally added them through those CTP updates.

It was added in in the November CTP update. Then user defined literals was not supported either. They’ve added them in CTP 14 which later became VS 2015. And a bunch of these incomplete implementations and differences. They’ve probably released their compilers because they didn’t want to fall behind and be left out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI even remember having to write tons of workarounds because their compiler and standard library was never following the standards.
