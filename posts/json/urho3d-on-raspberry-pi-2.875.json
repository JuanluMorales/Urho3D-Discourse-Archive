No X11 needed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I did was get the cross-compiler that Arch uses for armv7 (not armv6) and for the system root I literally just mounted the Pi2’s sysroot using sshfs which I found much easier than replicating one on the host machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far I just needed to bump the GPU memory to 256MB and 1920x1200 res works but I brought it down to 720x480 for extra FPS which I needed to do in /boot/config.txt as the -x -y flags didn’t do anything. I set multi sample to -m 4 and I didn’t notice a huge performance hit at all!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m guessing the character demo issue is a known problem where some of the skinning is glitched, presumably because there’s only half the uniforms passed down to the shader on the Pi and the skinned character has more than 32 bones. I also noticed shadows didn’t render but I didn’t investigate this hugely, but render2texture stuff worked fine (it crashed though before I set it to use 256MB).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I’d share my experience if anyone else wants to try it out or need verification that it does indeed work on the Pi2 using armv7, and on a distro that’s not raspian or pidora… \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:03:42.082Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":20,"reads":10,"readers_count":9,"score":102.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":875,"topic_slug":"urho3d-on-raspberry-pi-2","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":69,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":4971,"name":"Yao Wei Tjong","username":"weitjong","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/weitjong/{size}/4_2.png","created_at":"2015-02-25T04:58:04.000Z","cooked":"\u003caside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"boberfly\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/b/aeb1de/40.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003e boberfly:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m guessing the character demo issue is a known problem where some of the skinning is glitched, presumably because there’s only half the uniforms passed down to the shader on the Pi and the skinned character has more than 32 bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, this is a known issue.

I don’t have RPI2 to play with yet. I believe we can tweak some of the build configuration to better use of the available hardware, using armv-7a instead of armv6 and using the NEON FPU support, etc. I think we should also check whether RPI2 has the same caps as older RPI model, so perhaps we can increase the number of uniforms passed and/or the number of physical/logical CPU cores that can be utilised (it is hardcoded to 1 at the moment for RPI).\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:03:42.255Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":1,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":10,"readers_count":9,"score":2.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":875,"topic_slug":"urho3d-on-raspberry-pi-2","display_username":"Yao Wei Tjong","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"Admin","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":4,"hidden":false,"trust_level":4,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":4980,"name":"","username":"boberfly","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/b/aeb1de/{size}.png","created_at":"2015-02-25T06:55:26.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eHi weitjong\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can do some tests and patches for these.
