Hi, I'm using Urho3d for a mobile games that the players can chat inside the game. I'm trying to display unicode text which it could contain characters from many different languages(including Asian languages) together, so far I can't find a way to do it. The example provided with Urho3d shows displaying text with setting one font, I wonder if there is way to make Urho3d to load glyph from different fonts if the current font does not provide the needed glyph.

In short, the following are my questions :
1) How to display a text that contains multiple languages(including Asian languages) characters?
2) Embedding fonts of all common languages will significantly increase the size of the game, is there a standard way to use system font or system font rendering across different platforms in Urho3d?
