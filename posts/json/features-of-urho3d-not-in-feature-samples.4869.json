Also worked in additional features native to hololens and windows UWP, including the hololens samples done by \u003ca class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/egorbo\"\u003e@Egorbo\u003c/a\u003e. There’s no mouse with hololens (but there is a clicker, which I don’t use), so needed a different method of input.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen added a series of actions that work across all the samples, such as scene controls and basic first person shooter. So you can throw things at the pyramid, or shoot ragdolls en masse or individually, or paint decals or flowers on any object.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorked through numerous issues, not all of which are solved, such as lack of shadows. Got most of the materials and models, including the PBR materials and water working. Though had to use some workarounds due to the SharpReality binding implementation using StereoApplication as the base application interface. Will put up a project showcase in the next couple weeks. Want to see if I can work through some of the remaining issues, and maybe put a little bit of lipstick on the pig that it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut anyway, some of those feature samples viewed via the hololens are really stunning. When new users see the automated demo, most of them stand there with their mouths open and don’t know what to say, their brains are overstimulated. Experienced VR users seem rather non-plussed, but note the difference between VR and AR immediately. Various researchers put AR as a smaller subset of VR, but after viewing these demos, it would seem most agree VR is a smaller subset of AR.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2019-01-25T21:28:18.012Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":27,"reads":55,"readers_count":54,"score":153.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":4869,"topic_slug":"features-of-urho3d-not-in-feature-samples","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":2,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1086,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":27672,"name":"Leith Ketchell","username":"Leith","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/leith/{size}/2384_2.png","created_at":"2019-01-27T04:20:23.614Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThere appears to be mountains of stuff that is either not well documented, not displayed in existing samples, or both.\u003cbr\u003e\nI’m quite new to Urho3D, but not to game engines, or engine development.\u003cbr\u003e\nI’ve personally struggled to absorb the entire codebase in response to the lack of information in the public domain, but the local inhabitants of this forum are generally quick to respond with useful information for any use-case I have put forward.\u003cbr\u003e\nI have to note, I do not use SharpReality, and tend not to use scripting in general.\u003cbr\u003e\nTo me, learning script bindings is just another layer of complexity on top of learning how the engine works - a separate API, with different naming conventions and different limitations.\u003cbr\u003e\nI’m happy that I can work with a data-driven scenario, for most use-cases.\u003cbr\u003e\nJust yell if you need help with something specific, but I suggest you do be specific, otherwise your generic question will receive a generic response.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2019-01-27T04:22:16.731Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":48,"readers_count":47,"score":14.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":4869,"topic_slug":"features-of-urho3d-not-in-feature-samples","display_username":"Leith Ketchell","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"suspended user","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1098,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"user_suspended":true,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":27673,"name":"","username":"I3DB","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/i/3ec8ea/{size}.png","created_at":"2019-01-27T04:25:05.577Z","cooked":"\u003caside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Leith\" data-post=\"2\" data-topic=\"4869\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/leith/40/2384_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003e Leith:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere appears to be mountains of stuff that is either not well documented, not displayed in existing samples\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould you be more specific, just one or two items or features that aren’t in the Feature Samples?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not so much asking for help for some problem in this thread, as I am asking if there are features I’m still unaware of, and that I can dig into and work into a demo.
