Is there any kind of video playback support in Urho3D?

Thanks.  I had seen the first one but not the other two.

It's doable. I've implemented a reversed variant of BINK before (as a custom UIElement). There's nothing in the core, but all of the building blocks are there. I have no idea how to even approach making that stuff general purpose though.

Shameless plug: [my TS](https://github.com/JSandusky/TS), grep on windows ... but better. How I reversed the format for BINK (binary search mode).
