I see the Issue number:153

Any news about it?

I would sure like this too!  Yet I also understand that this probably is not as important is some other features being worked on.  I much effort would it take to add support?  Unfortunately, I doubt that I will be of much help.

I have the Oculus DK2. I am a C++ newbie. If someone help me I am trying to start develop something :wink:
But it is very difficult!

There is also a Book to understand Oculus VR SDK:

If anyone can help, post here some tips or sample code.
