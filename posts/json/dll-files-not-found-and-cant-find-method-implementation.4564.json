When I try to run the WinForms Projekt, I get an error that it can’t find CoreData.pak in \\bin\\Desktop.  This was on line 20 of SamplesForm.cs where the AssetsDirectory is set, so I’m assuming something in that folder is trying to reference the wrong path to CoreData.pak.  So I did a search and copied CoreData.pak from \\packages\\UrhoSharp.1.8.71\\native\\ into \\bin\\Desktop.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTried to compile again, and I got another error that it can’t find the mono-urho DLL file.
