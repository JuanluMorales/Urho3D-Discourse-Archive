Hello everyone!
Can you help me with creating a new project in Code::Blocks? Can I make it from scratch (eg create a new empty project and include headers, libraries without any .sh files)? I use Ubuntu.

Hello star28! and welcome to the forums.

Similar to CodeLite IDE; when I used CB I started with "Empty Project", in its settings specified "Custom Makefile", and specified the makefile generated by the Urho cmake build script(s) as described in the docs.

You can have separate build trees for debug/release, and the makefiles should regenerate themselves when the Urho library changes.

HTH, Tell us how it's going
