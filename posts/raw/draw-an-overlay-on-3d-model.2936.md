Hi, I am working with a 3D character model and I am struggling to add an overlay to body part of the character (as in this image). 

<img src="//cdck-file-uploads-global.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/1X/12757212b94634600a5eb0c4a41f6674b2a8bd89.png" width="460" height="500">

I need to add/remove this overlay dynamically to different body parts when it is needed. It would be great if anyone can provide me directions to achieve this.

Thanks.

You want to highlight a part of a body, or draw clothes on top ?

I want to highlight a part of the body not to draw clothes on top.
