If you are using express editions or in my case an old vs2010 pro edition go and grab visual studio 2013 community edition for free.  This was released yesterday.  It supports plugins which was always historically lacking in the free editions.

The graphics debugger will be rather useful. Though using it to full potential also requires Windows 8.1 it seems.

From what I have heard is that it works on xp but it installs the 8.1 sdk.  This is good since windows sdk includes the d3d shader compiler.
