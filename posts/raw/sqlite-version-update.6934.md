Is there a reason SQLite is still so far behind on the version number? If not and I were to make a PR would that get it done?

There are some "new" features I want. Maybe I can give a little back to the community, even if it is such a small thing.

You are welcome to submit the PR. I believe there is no specific technical reason, other than no one has the time nor interest to.

Oof, thanks! Now to figure out how to add this second commit to the existing PR...

**Edit**
Oh, it did it by itself.
