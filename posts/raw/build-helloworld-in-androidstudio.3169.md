We have not updated our build scripts for Android platform. Currently the documentation is still using old instructions and is still referring to now-defunct ```android``` sub-command when you use the latest Android SDK. This is a known issue. Use the "Search" functionality in the forum to see how others solve the issue. There was also a discussion to modernise the build script to use Gradle. I would even advocate to use gradle-script-kotlin (I found the new DSL in release 0.90 is quite nice to work with already). The question is, who will do it first for Urho3D project.
