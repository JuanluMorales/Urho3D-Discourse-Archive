This could be really useful for small teams using Urho.

Maybe this means MS will do what Khronos seems unable to and actually finish SPIR-V Cross. Khronos has been downhill since the OpenCL *doesn't actually suck* fluke, assuming this isn't just a *corporate jam shed* project there could be hope of MS stepping up and saving the day.
