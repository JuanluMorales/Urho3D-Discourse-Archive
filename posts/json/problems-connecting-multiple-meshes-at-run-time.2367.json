Suppose we have a single Mesh for the torso of all humanoid characters. At the base of the neck we create a vertex group with a known shape, and we name that group something useful, like “Head.Connection”. Now, for the different races, we have just models of the heads with a vertex group with the same name and of the same size, and we sew those together at load time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve read the dynamic geometry example, which was greatly enlightening towards that goal, but while it modifies the raw vertex data from the geometry, it does not actually assemble different geometry via connections.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe problem is I cannot figure out how to get the vertex group names from the models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a look at the APIs for Model, Geometry and some other classes, trying to figure out if I could grab a vertex group name from it, but could not find that info.\u003cbr\u003e\nI don’t know if this is a limitation form assimp or Urho’s API.\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I did see was that when exporting from blender to wavefront (.obj) it did list a group (line that was like “o Head.Vertices”), though I might have done something wrong and it didn’t seem to have any vertices within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother possibility I was thinking about is using the scene graph to compose the objects, and loading the connection information from a json or xml file. But this would be kind of a pain to do by hand, and it seems like it would not allow for a proper mesh-deforming skeleton, please correct me if I’m wrong here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, any insight is greatly appreciated!  \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=5\" title=\":smiley:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":smiley:\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLucas\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:15:00.542Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":26,"reads":9,"readers_count":8,"score":131.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":2367,"topic_slug":"problems-connecting-multiple-meshes-at-run-time","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":579,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":14269,"name":"","username":"rbnpontes","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/rbnpontes/{size}/1207_2.png","created_at":"2016-10-30T11:38:29.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eIf i’m understand what did say, you need a Customization Character in runtime, i have this problem when i’m working in unity, because i’m loaded realtime meshes at the Objects.\u003cbr\u003e\nIn urho its possible but is more complicated, First you need all Objects has a bone and rig for Sync parts and deform at realtime, or you modify vertex by runtime, anyway what you need is more complicated.
