I‚Äôve noticed with our other Billboards, to avoid this dither, the image we render to the billboard simply needs to have a transparent margin around the edge.   Whenever we have opaque pixels near the edge of the image, it causes this same dither.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe solution seems clear-- just make sure you have transparent pixels at the edge of all images intended for billboards.  However, since Text3D is built in, I think we‚Äôd have to modify the Core Urho3D code to fix this ‚Äì or we‚Äôll have to make our own version of Text3D (we could base it off Urho‚Äôs).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two defects we have with Text3D right now are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThis dithering defect, and\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe can‚Äôt set the ‚ÄúRenderOrder‚Äù ‚Äì it‚Äôs stuck at 128.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, it‚Äôs looking like we‚Äôll have to make our own Text3D Rendering feature, unless there is an easy workaround for these two defects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere‚Äôs an image of the Samples of Text3D (‚ÄúSignedDistanceFieldText‚Äù).   If you set the Camera motion scalar to 0.01, and the move forwards or backwards, those edges look like crazy escalators‚Ä¶ very distracting.  As a still shot, this isn‚Äôt too bad.  But when you start moving slowly ‚Äì these are turn into animated escalators!  (and our Map application in Track mode, moves slowly, pixel-by-pixel, this Text3D looks pretty bad).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg
