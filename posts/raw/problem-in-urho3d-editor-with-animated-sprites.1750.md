Somebody knows if Urho3D editor can load Animated Sprites made with Spriter?

When I load a .scml I can't see anything there.

I have no problems with static sprites.

Hey Kanfor, it does work in the editor. Did you press or toggle the Play or 'RunUpdatePlay' button? 

As for the loading part, try saving the sample 2D sprite scene and load it in the editor. :slight_smile:
