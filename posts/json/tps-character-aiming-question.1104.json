What i want is if the player looks up rotate his arms up or if looks down rotate his hands down (like the character’s head in CharacterDemo example but keep the aim animation looping and somehow offsetting his hand’'s roation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to modify the offsetMatrix of the bones but it seems that modifing the matrix of a bone will not affect it’s children.
