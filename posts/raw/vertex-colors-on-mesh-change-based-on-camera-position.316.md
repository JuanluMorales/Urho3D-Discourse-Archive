I've got a basic camera, a loaded model, and a zone with ambient light. The model is not textured, its material only specifies vertex colors. Sometimes when I get the camera relatively close to the mesh (but not going through it) the vertex colors change. You can see how the black material gets replaced with the brown material. Any ideas what's going on here?

Here's my mesh: [url]https://www.dropbox.com/s/hq8auovfdr59eak/AK.blend[/url]
