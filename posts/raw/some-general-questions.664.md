Hello, 

I am a professional game developer and i am planning to release my game which has been approved on Steam Greenlight during the next year (i keep my project name secret for the moment on this forum).

I am very interested to use urho3D as a game engine base and expand it's features. You guys are doing a great work :slight_smile:

I have some questions before making the switch !

1- Is there any automated way to generate the "include" folder when i am building the engine from the source ? 

2- I have noticed that the decals in the decals sample are not affected by lights and shadows. Is it possible to make them affected by the lighting ? Or is it planned ?

3- Is there any roadmap for the engine or can you tell me which are the next big planned features ? 

4- What about the recast "detourcrowd" integration ? will it be finished soon or should i add this feature myself ? 

Thank you for your time and i am looking forward to discuss with you guys. :wink:

That's my project for my christmas holiday, the current implementation needs a re-write because it just doesn't work well with the serialization system at the moment.

Thank you for the answers guys :slight_smile:

I am using the engine since some days now and i really like how the engine is more focused on core features (scene system, serialization system, network replication, utility classes...) rather than eye candy stuff at the moment (i am sure that some nice new graphical features will come in the future).

I will have some questions that im going to post in the support forum section.
