It looks like those options will have issue, and will incur extra CPU-load per object.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looks to me like I can’t programmatically tell Urho which quality level to use on an object-by-object basis… it’s a “Renderer” setting.   And if I tell it to sort by distance, then I’m just giving Urho more-work-to-do (CPU) per frame by making it calculate Camera-Distance-to-each-object, and then sifting through the techniques.   I’m not sure how efficient Urho is at doing this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eISSUE: I determine LOD for an entire group of tiles based on Camera Y-Position.   So when Y drops below 100, I want to change the Technique for 100 tiles all at once.   I’d prefer to not have Urho doing “distance math” for all 100 tiles every frame, to determine if I’m close enough – PLUS – that math will NOT do it consistently for all tiles at once… because the tiles directly below the camera will be closer that those near to the edge of the screen… so Distance-based Technique Switching is bad, because the centered tiles will switch over before those at the edge, and this’ll look funny, since it’s one contiguous map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I opt for Quality-based switching, then I am limited to 3 quality levels (0 to 2) for all tiles… AND then lose the ability for users to toggle up/down the quality of rendering based upon their device specs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e===\u003cbr\u003e\nSo I think I need something different than both of those.   In the absence of alternate advice, I am considering just using the “SetTechnique()” for each object when the camera crosses that threshold.  So I make 100 calls at the Y-threshold, and then am done.   Does this sound efficient/reasonable?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think that may be a better approach than using “SetMaterial” to get the job done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can either call “Model.SetMaterial()” 100x for the switch, or “Material.SetTechnique()” 100x.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew Idea:\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrently each tile has it’s own Material instance (clone).  I think this might be a case where I can assign the SAME material to all 100 objects.  And then, to switch the technique, it only requires ONE call to Material.SetTechnique().\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEDIT:   New Idea won’t work, at least not without added complexity.  Currently there are various raster tiles that overlay each other (e.g… the more detailed city map overlays the lower-detail state map), and so I deal with this using “RenderOrder” (so I’d need to have at least one material per RenderOrder).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there is the matter of Fading In/Out – which is another ShaderParameter, that is dynamically set upon Fading-in/out.

At minimum, I’d need to have one material for each RenderOrder used, and a separate materials for batches of tiles as they fade in/out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI may still go this route, but it’s not as simple as just having “one material for all tiles”.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":5,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2020-12-27T18:43:54.690Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":4,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":29,"readers_count":28,"score":10.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":6635,"topic_slug":"best-way-to-toggle-shader-techniques-or-materials","display_username":"Brian Knox","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":2,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"reply_to_user":{"username":"Eugene","name":"Eugene Kozlov","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/eugene/{size}/902_2.png"},"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1334,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":41385,"name":"J Tippetts","username":"JTippetts1","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/jtippetts1/{size}/96_2.png","created_at":"2020-12-28T01:22:19.572Z","cooked":"\u003caside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"najak3d\" data-post=\"5\" data-topic=\"6635\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/n/6a8cbe/40.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003e najak3d:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEugene, I did see that.

I may tend to optimize prematurely.  But in general, I just like to design an approach that isn’t wasteful.
