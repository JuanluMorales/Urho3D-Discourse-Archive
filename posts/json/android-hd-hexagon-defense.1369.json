A very simple game of quick thinking, reflexes, and a bit of luck, HD can be picked up and played in seconds. The app’s target audience is my fellow high school students, who love anything that they can play to fill the free time in their day. I’d been looking into Urho for some time now, as it looks like a very well produced engine. I was going to use it for Ludum Dare 31, but at the time I was not familiar with the engine. Prototyped in less than a week by myself a few friends, this was my project to finally learn Urho, and it’s left me wanting to use it even more. I’m excited to see what else I can accomplish with Urho.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecial thanks to the Urho forums and especially the IRC!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can pick up \u003ca href=\"http://j.mp/hd_app\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eHD: Hexagon Defense on the Google Play Store\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:07:15.070Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":8,"reads":3,"readers_count":2,"score":40.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":1369,"topic_slug":"android-hd-hexagon-defense","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://j.mp/hd_app","internal":false,"reflection":false,"clicks":8},{"url":"https://imgur.com/a/GQty8","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Imgur: The most awesome images on the Internet","clicks":8}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":312,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":7844,"name":"","username":"Bananaft","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/bananaft/{size}/222_2.png","created_at":"2015-09-16T07:25:50.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eIt says, it’s incompatible with all of my devices.
