In Maya, when you select an object and press F, the camera focuses on that object. Is there something similar on Urho's editor?

In std mode I guessing that not have such ability, but you can select "blender mode" in Editor settings and then pick object with mouse and press key F to focus on them or "closer function" by pressing "dot" on num pad.

and of course you may read this manual before : [urho3d.github.io/documentation/H ... tions.html](http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_editor_instructions.html)

Simply double-click on the node in Hierarchy window.
