Sorry if I'm posting at the wrong place.  
I removed http and replaced dots with asterisks.

I was scrolling down the main page (urho3d*github*io/) and clicked on the links to see what the large logo looked like. [color=#636363]</story>[/color] 
The links are:
[color=#FF8000]urho3d*github*io/[/color][color=#FF0000]{{ BASE_PATH }}/[/color][color=#FF8000]assets/images/logo-big*jpg
urho3d*github*io/[/color][color=#FF0000]{{ BASE_PATH }}/[/color][color=#FF8000]assets/images/logo-big-bw*png[/color]
They should be:
[color=#00BF40]urho3d*github*io/assets/images/logo-big*jpg
urho3d*github*io/assets/images/logo-big-bw*png[/color]

Welcome to our forum. Thanks for pointing this out. It will be fixed soon. BTW, after a first post, I think the forums should allow the next post to contain any hyperlinks.
