So, you can consider those that remain have at least passed the first casual/visual review and have a good chance to be merged or have merits for further discussion even if they don’t make it at the end. However, until one of the core team member (which effectively only left with me and Eugene active lately) has the free time to actually review and/or try the code, they will remain stuck there for a while. I don’t know about others but my excuse is having to take turn to take care of my autistic daughter who just gone through multi-stage eye surgeries, so when I still choose to spend some of my remaining free time for Urho then I actually do it for my own pleasure and not for pressure, tending to pick those that I have interest and are easier for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are also right to point out that the rate of merging slows down after Lasse stepped down from lead role. None of us have the same level of insight of the engine to review and merge the PR as efficient as him even when we have all the time it needs. This is the consequence of losing someone that important to the project. But rest assured all the core team members have a license to kill or merge a PR on their own.

Nevertheless, I wonder if there would be a way to take advantage of community collaboration to share the burden though. For instance, if people were encouraged to do code reviews on PRs, that could actually improve the code that went in and it might be a way to share the technical part of the effort while leaving the actual decision to you.
