Hi

Could someone help me add the package system to my applicatioon? Basically  I want to put resourcestools in a package or specific directories in it like Textures,   Materials, and Models. Then make a client download the package from a server right after a player logs in..

The intro screen I want to be put of a installed package when downloaded(mine executable).
