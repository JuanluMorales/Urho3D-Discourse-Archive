It is most likely not the best way to do things, but I am kind of creating a tiled map on top of ground for showing the area where the unit can move. It looks normal and fine on desktop (both windows and linux), but the problem is my phone. This same thing even happens on the sample: 10_RenderToTexture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere is the picture \u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/Q8rX41q.png\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttp://i.imgur.com/Q8rX41q.png\u003c/a\u003e the whole area should consist blue planes of same size, like tiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know that the cause is that the plane is too close to the object behind it. I set the planes to be 0.1f higher, and I also noticed that if I set the camera closer to the planes, they appear without the lines, so it is somehow distance based thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis thing also sometimes seems to happen even with the decals at least on my phone, which makes me wonder if this is mostly something to do with my phone (Nexus 5 + lollipop 5.1), or does it also happen on other opengles systems?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething that I noticed is, that the lines always appear to be horizontal line. Also the width of a single line seems to be the same. Considering that the blue area consists of 11 different planes, it is interesting how it actually creates the lines horizontally regardless from what angle the camera is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso for some reason depending on what angle from the ground I am watching, the lines appear to be wider, same goes depending how far the camera is from the planes. If I set the camera close enough, the blocks are shown completely and there is no “lines” at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePictures to compare camera angle:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/06IkRGx.png\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttp://i.imgur.com/06IkRGx.png\u003c/a\u003e vs\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/ldiV5uE.png\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttp://i.imgur.com/ldiV5uE.png\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess one way to fix it would be to simply just set the distance further away from the ground, or maybe I can set the height of the tiles higher if the camera is further away from the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: Also this thing has been on the urho as long as I have been dabbling with urho (at least 3 months), so it is not something that has appeared in recent patches.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:05:03.868Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":11,"reads":4,"readers_count":3,"score":55.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":1049,"topic_slug":"solved-how-to-fix-an-issue-when-drawing-objects-too-close","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://i.imgur.com/Q8rX41q.png","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Q8rX41q.png","clicks":1},{"url":"http://i.imgur.com/06IkRGx.png","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"06IkRGx.png","clicks":0},{"url":"http://i.imgur.com/ldiV5uE.png","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"ldiV5uE.png","clicks":0}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":205,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":6059,"name":"Lasse Öörni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2015-05-07T13:07:44.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThis is caused by too low depth buffer resolution, which depends on the device.
