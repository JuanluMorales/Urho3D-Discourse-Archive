Looking for how to create games today I found several engines, but this seemed quite promising, but opening the scripts I just saw how to load the 3d model of the character and make enemies appear with ninja snow war

How do you actually use the engine? do I have to create and edit scenes in the editor at the same time I type the script?

how do I know my camera will follow the character and how do I know I'll to control a 3D model already loaded in the scene?

any tutorial step by step? since putting 3d models in the scene/world until script?

Let me first answer your questions with another one: What experience do you have with programming?
You can keep track of `Node`s and `Component`s using pointers or look them up in the `Scene` using various functions. There is the [Wiki](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/wiki) which might be helpful and of course the [Documentation](https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/).

The first program I made using Urho3D was based on a sample. I simply transcribed all lines that seems essential.

Also, welcome to the forums! :confetti_ball:

Take a look and study the exampkes... The script version. One atva time. They are an excellent start point. Once you have a clue, pick the one that fits your needs the most and use ait as a sort of tempkate to start building your own.
