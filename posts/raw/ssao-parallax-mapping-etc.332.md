Ok, couple of features that I will need at some time (I might try to get some of these working but if someone already have these, could share?)

* SSAO                (horde3d forum have SSAO code, maybe it can be re-used   [horde3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=1706](http://www.horde3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=1706) )

* 3D particle example

* Soft particles   (I have done this couple of other engines, I will try to do it to this too)

* Parallax mapping   (this is one I dont know even how to start?)
 
* God rays  ( [fabiensanglard.net/lightScattering/](http://fabiensanglard.net/lightScattering/) )

I try to code some of these and will share if I success.

I'm also trying to do some ambient occlusion shaders. You can look here:
[github.com/reattiva/r/tree/master/r_AO](https://github.com/reattiva/r/tree/master/r_AO)
I'll try to clean it this week. Only OpenGL for now.

Some time ago on the old Urho3D google forum I've posted a soft billboard example, I'll try to update it.

Excellent, thanks. I surely will check these out.
And yeah, I like glsl but never coded in hlsl. I think there is hlsl2glsl but not glsl2hlsl, so maybe I should learn hlsl and convert shaders to glsl..well, we will see, time tells.
