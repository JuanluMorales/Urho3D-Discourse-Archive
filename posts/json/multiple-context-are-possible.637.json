I was able to compile the demos and editor. (My first time running CMAKE scripts and it was really painless!  \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=5\" title=\":smiley:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":smiley:\"\u003e ) Really wonderful engine!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked all over the documentation, because I would have liked to open multiple windows with Urho3D rendering in GL inside each of them. Might also be useful for rendering on multiple screens (3 screens for racing games for example).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere seem to be a context class in the graphic subsystem that could perhaps do that, as I see that everything that is created in a screen need a context pointer. Is it something that is possible at the moment with Urho3D 1.32?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have also another question, I was not able to produce the documentation, but I don’t have doxigen, must it be installed so the docs are produced? This is not a big issue, as I’m looking on the site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy primary interest for Urho is for creating game demos, and graphic tools.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:01:49.022Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":83,"reads":16,"readers_count":15,"score":418.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":637,"topic_slug":"multiple-context-are-possible","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":171,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":3482,"name":"","username":"OvermindDL1","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/o/a8b319/{size}.png","created_at":"2014-12-08T08:58:06.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eI have not tested it, but assuming no singletons anywhere (not that I have seen anyway) it might be possible to create multiple different Context’s and Engines to have unique renderers in different windows?

Multi-context is not a use case we support or plan for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn’t recommend creating eg. 3 separate instances of Urho in the same process and loading the same scene content and resources in each to get multiple windows showing the same content, as that’d be 3 times the memory use. Rather, if you want that, you should see what modifications it takes in the graphics / window handling code to get multiple windows without hacks, and with only a single instance of Urho, by possibly “moving” its graphics context between the windows. Considering that you would need to handle both D3D and OpenGL, and all OS’es (if SDL doesn’t do it for you) it can get complex, and it’s exactly because of the possible complexity why Urho3D right now doesn’t even try to support multiple OS windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if you manage to do it, and in a clean manner, we will naturally appreciate a pull request \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":3,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:01:49.846Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":1,"reads":17,"readers_count":16,"score":8.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":637,"topic_slug":"multiple-context-are-possible","display_username":"Lasse Öörni","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"Urho3D Author","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":3,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":3497,"name":"","username":"christianclavet","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/c/76d3ee/{size}.png","created_at":"2014-12-08T23:11:31.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThanks!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince we have networking in the engine, for doing an editor external windows, I could use the localhost to have 2 instance of urho communicate with each other (I think Lightwave and it’s modeler used that method).
