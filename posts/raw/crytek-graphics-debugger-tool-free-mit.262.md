It's only support DirectX 11, so it's useless if using Urho.  :frowning:

But the base is made, and going to have opengl support. Urho need update to dx10 and 11.

Yeah, after doing some guglin', there's plan for supporting OpenGL.

Looks promising, but until then I'll stick to AMD GPU PerfStudio ([url]http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/graphics-development/gpu-perfstudio-2/[/url])
It got some amazing features for graphics programmer and it got partial Linux support too. Unfortunately, some features only available for AMD GPU. You can see this debugger in-action here:
