It isn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>In 1996 to 1998 I optimized OpenGL device drivers for Digital Equipment Corporation workstations on Windows NT.  We had the DEC Alpha CPU, the fastest in the world at the time, and still the best CPU RISC architecture I\u2019ve seen to this day.  I was a super elite assembly coder jock, as good as anyone in the world on this specific chip.  We had a strategic alliance with Microsoft.  We were trying to kneecap Silicon Graphics, then the 900 lb. gorilla of the 3d graphics workstation and rendering farm world.  Integraph was doing the heavy lifting with their \u201ccheap\u201d Intel based workstations, but we were doing our part too.  And in not that many years, we all won.  SGI died, slain, a titan falling hard into the dirt.  They had additional screw-ups, like hemorrhaging the 3d engineers that formed NVIDIA and 3dfx Interactive.  They were anti-commodity and anti-Intel, they wanted to sell their own MIPS processors, and that hubris ultimately killed them.  The world was changing to a commodified marketplace and they simply wouldn\u2019t get with the times or make appropriate investments in <strong>consumer grade OpenGL</strong>.</p>\n<p>In this environment, Microsoft the proprietary overlord, foisted DirectX on us.  First versions were <em>very bad</em>.  They bought this company called Rendermophics and just ripped the lid off their cheesy implementation, to produce DX 3.x.  I forget the exact version number or letter, but I want to say 3.0a.  Us jocks had <em>huge</em> fights on Usenet about the stupidity of all of this.  Had to do with immediate vs. retained mode models of API, with very bad consequences to performance of the HW of the period.  These Rendermorphics people were complete amateurs and couldn\u2019t HW their way out of a paper bag.  I think they were London based; Microsoft summoned them to Redmond and decapitated them.</p>\n<p>Microsoft got busy and produced DX5, the first <em>decent</em> version of it.  OpenGL had a real proprietary threat aimed right at it.  It was now incumbent upon the OpenGL ARB, the consortium of vendors that worked out the standard, to <em>act</em>, to meet the threat.  Because of their competing business interests, they mostly proved unable to do so.  A proprietary company has a much easier time <em>executing</em> a strategy, than a bunch of companies trying to cooperate with each other.</p>\n<p>The consumer PC did <em>not</em> get OpenGL investments from the ARB vendors, because they were mostly Unix workstation guys.  And then Microsoft <em>kneecapped</em> OpenGL on their platform.  We worked closely with the Microsoft team in Redmond, we were only 2 miles away in Bellevue.  Internally they decided at some point, <em>no future investments</em> in OpenGL.  We were allies and under NDA, so we couldn\u2019t talk about it.  Microsoft would hold developer conferences and <em>flat out lie</em> to people about what was going to happen to OpenGL.  It was going to die, it was being killed as they spoke, and they told everyone the opposite.  To get the most distance over people while slicing the knife into the jugular.  I hope I held my grimaces back sufficiently in public, when they were saying all of this, as I knew my duty to DEC.</p>\n<p>It torpedoed our efforts in the DEC Commodity Graphics group to provide cheap OpenGL implementations on Windows NT.  We worked closely with Microsoft and were reliant on their codebase to make our own stuff work cost effectively.  When they cancelled, we were in a serious bind.  So serious that ultimately I quit my job and moved on.  We could have tried to do heroics and make totally our own codebase, but our boss didn\u2019t think we could do it in time and be market relevant.  He may have been right.  We will never know.  We were crippled by Microsoft, and then internal politics threatening the DEC Alpha itself, finished us off.  Compaq sought to buy DEC.  Within 6 months after I left, our Commodity Graphics group was no more, and my peers were out finding new jobs.</p>\n<p>A few years down the road, SGI imploded and Khronos emerged.  They seemed to have few real resources for development.  They had one last chance to save OpenGL, with their release of 3.0.  I forget the details now, but somehow they did a rather bad job with it.  They couldn\u2019t execute or stay relevant.  And so finally, Microsoft\u2019s long campaign of terror against it, bore its final fruit and it drifted unrecoverably towards death.</p>\n<p>The moral of this story is that when a proprietary vendor dominates an OS platform, they <em>will</em> win.  They can make crippling decisions to control their platform.  Nowadays you don\u2019t just have Microsoft playing this game, you <em>also</em> have Apple playing this game with Metal.  Apple historically had very tepid support for OpenGL, they grumbled a lot and dragged their feet about implementations.  If Apple had decided to back Vulkan to modernize, then it could have had a chance.  But they didn\u2019t, they decided to dominate everything with Metal.  It\u2019s their corporate DNA to do so, they also are doing Swift instead of Objective C now.  Lock you into their ecosphere by any and all available means.  I already know exactly how this plays out, having seen it during the Windows monopoly era.</p>\n<p>Now it is possible, that DX12, Metal, and Vulkan are all <em>so</em> similar, compared to historical differences between DirectX and OpenGL, that the engineering side of things is not really a problem.  I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t kept up, I don\u2019t write device drivers anymore.  So maybe if you could snap your fingers and produce the needed support <em>right now</em>, everyone could be happy with Vulkan everywhere.</p>\n<p>The problem is, all Apple <em>or</em> Microsoft has to do to wreck that, is just change something.  They control the destiny, not Khronos.

Then they release OpenGL in 1992, with the <em>full intent</em> of mostly dictating how OpenGL is going to be developed and used.  They make other Unix workstation vendors dependent upon them, especially with respect to their OpenGL Sample Implementation codebase.  Workstation vendors have some wiggle room in principle within this open standard, but in practice, OpenGL is designed to perform best on <em>SGI hardware</em>.  They control this world.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, many battles happen in Unix land for control.  You are right that cross-platform solutions soften brand locks here.  Eventually Linux comes along, creating a new low end option in the Unix market.</p>\n<p>Here comes Microsoft!  They want to get into the expensive high end Workstation market.  They ship <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Windows NT</a> in 1993, same time as Linux and Java are getting off the ground.  CAD workstation seats are way too expensive back then, so Integraph allies with MS to make cheaper Intel CAD boxes.  DEC has the Alpha, and also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">VMS</a> which used to compete with Unix.  They have a Unix too, but they\u2019re a minor player in that market and not Unix loyalists.  They ally in the crusade to dethrone SGI, with both expensive and relatively cheap DEC Alpha Windows NT workstations.</p>\n<p>MS wins!  \u201cVeni, Vidi, Vici!\u201d with Windows NT.  The only reason you are doing Unix today, is Linux and the FSF.  They saved the show.  If Linux had never happened, then you\u2019d be using Windows today.  The FSF with Richard M. Stallman would have <em>never</em> gotten the job done.  Mr. Stallman can\u2019t execute in industry.  Linus Torvaldis can.  If he hadn\u2019t existed, you\u2019d have needed someone else like him to come along, to save us from The Beast.</p>\n<p>When Steve Jobs came back to rescue Apple, he brought the Mach kernel and NextStep based technology with him.  So if Linux didn\u2019t exist, Unix could have had a resurgence then.  But Mr. Jobs was a controlling asshole, as big an asshole about locking you in as Bill Gates ever was.  Jobs didn\u2019t even want you <em>opening your Mac case</em>.  He went to extraordinary lengths to tie the Apple user\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p>Once Apple shipped the iPhone, they gained real power.  It made them tons of money and made them more important than Microsoft!  And now they want to take over the whole world, every single business and market they can get into.  They fight with Google, Amazon, and Facebook for control, but it\u2019s not <em>cross-platform</em> that loosens their grip.  They\u2019re Walled Garden all the way down, they don\u2019t believe in cross-platform.  Their grip is loosened by <em>fights in the consumer market</em>, for control.  They\u2019re not a monopoly, people do switch phones.</p>\n<p>They are <em>never</em> going to make it easy to do Vulkan.  The minute someone gets something sorta workable together, they\u2019re gonna <em>change Metal</em>, to break it.  They\u2019ll do it at the API level, they\u2019ll do it at the device driver level.  Because <em>they can</em>, and they <em>want to</em>.  Just like MS wanted to do with DirectX vs. OpenGL once upon a time.  All the Apple execs can look back at history and confidently say, well that DX thing, it went really really well for Microsoft!  \u201cVeni, Vidi, Vici!\u201d</p>\n<p>Why would Apple help Linux?  Someone said, rightly or wrongly, that Android is a Linux.  Well Google is one of Apple\u2019s arch-rivals.  <em>Of course</em> you do your best to kneecap your rivals.

Its problem is that vendor implementations are often very buggy due to lack of interests and also the complexity required is huge.

I was just asking that because many major engines out there support multiple graphics systems, hence why you want OP to implement a certain API. Maybe he just wants to improve his skills in different areas he need, and an open source project is a good opportunity. If he won\u2019t be able to finish it, it is not like it will be accepted into Urho either.</p>\n<p>Btw, as much as we want to support cross platforms using the same code as much as possible. There will always be some differences and specific fast paths belong to certain APIs. For example, the traditional deferred rendering is not suitable for mobile GPUs even if the graphics APIs (GLES 3, vk, metal) supports doing so. On mobile, the deferred pass needs to be implemented differently on different graphics API in order to make it more efficient. MoltenVk won\u2019t solve this problem, its tessellation emulation is also a potential slow path since the way Metal\u2019s tessellation works is totally different from vk. But yeah, it is not very important for many people. Furthermore, at some points, maybe you should start removing legacy back-ends such as D3D9. Maintaining older graphics APIs are harder when the modern API design keeps going to a different direction .</p>\n<p>Anw, I did have a thought of implementing metal in Urho in the past, I want to add something useful to Urho using what I\u2019m good at (I suck at many other things).

It already has a number of things Urho3D might like to have, such as Vulkan, DX12, C++17, and generally speaking \u201cmodern\u201d attitudes towards the 3D engine problem.</p>\n<p>Indeed, one might wonder, why not just go work on that project instead?  The big thing I\u2019ve found lacking so far, is no obvious developer community or forum.  It may be open source, but it doesn\u2019t look like \u201ccontributions discussed or accepted\u201d open source.</p>\n<p>It also doesn\u2019t have any scripting language.  That doesn\u2019t strike me as a big difference though, because I won\u2019t ever use AngelScript.  If I did commit to Lua, it would have to be 5.4, and me implementing that support.  So from my standpoint, neither engine has scripting that I want.</p>\n<p>Anyways, apropos of Vulkan rendering concerns, they have a blog entry about <a href=\"http://diligentgraphics.com/2018/12/09/resource-state-management/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">resource state management</a>.  This is all really picky and involved.  It\u2019s very different from \u201cold school\u201d game programmer doesn\u2019t-have-to-care way of doing things.  If someone thinks they\u2019re going to do Vulkan or Metal or DX12 for Urho3D, they\u2019d probably be wise to study an engine that\u2019s already been walking down that road for 5 years.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Resource state management in Diligent Engine</h2>\n<p>The purpose of Diligent Engine is to provide efficient cross-platform low-level graphics API that is convenient to use, but at the same time is flexible enough to not limit the applications in expressing their intent. Before <a href=\"https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentEngine/releases/tag/v2.4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">version 2.4</a>, the ability of application to control resource state transitions was very limited. Version 2.4 made resource state transitions explicit and introduced two ways to manage the states. The first one is fully automatic, where the engine internally keeps track of the state and performs necessary transitions. The second one is manual and completely driven by the application.</p>\n</blockquote>", "post_number": 49, "post_type": 1, "updated_at": "2020-03-16T21:51:26.988Z", "reply_count": 0,
