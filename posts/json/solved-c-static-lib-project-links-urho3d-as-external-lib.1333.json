It basically just an archive of object files. Unless you have explicitly instructed your build system to archive all objects into one (this is an extra step that CMake does not do for you), the user of your static libraries need to link to each one of them for the final target normally. Perhaps you have confused it with a shared library. A shared library works differently where it has linked all the objects into one by default. So, in general you only need one shared lib (from your previous build stage) in linking the final
