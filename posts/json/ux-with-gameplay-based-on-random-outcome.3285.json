So the basic thing is you have to repeat everything again and again until everything is right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I see the games which exploit such approach are Bully and GTA SA from Rockstar (I did not play their newer games to compare). So it is not just repetition, it is repetition of hundreds iterations at times to complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked some people I know who played these and they told me that when they were younger and had\u003cbr\u003e\na lot of free time they liked it, but now at 30+ these games are incompletable for them and they basically lose motivation half-way. But as I aked 16 year old group, they played Bully game and given it shitty rating\u003cbr\u003e\ndescribing it is frustrating as game li interesting, but shitty minigames and  “class” games are extremely stupid\u003cbr\u003e\nuninteresting and unmotivating, and if not for humor and some interesting missions, game looks half-finished,\u003cbr\u003e\nprobably QA was not there when they released it. So both older people and youngsters did not like Bully,\u003cbr\u003e\nhowever it is one of most popular games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for GTA, I think the missions were really made to annoy player, not entertain him, so people\u003cbr\u003e\nprefer just to play sandbox activities (which are great) and only occasionally do missions only to do sandbox advancement (to have more nice sandbox activities). So GTA reward system forces player to do missions still,\u003cbr\u003e\nso he can improve his in-game life, while missions are shitty and of random quality (very little are motivating by themselves), players still continue playing the game for rewards. But it looks like while having better overall plot, Bully\u003cbr\u003e\nfails to reward player enough to motivate him to play the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I wonder if adding such puzzles/minigames with adequate reward would actually improve UX (hate it but can’t stop),\u003cbr\u003e\nor will worsen the game overall?\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-06-27T02:43:15.686Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":4,"reads":29,"readers_count":28,"score":25.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":3285,"topic_slug":"ux-with-gameplay-based-on-random-outcome","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":554,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":19021,"name":"","username":"S.L.C","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/s.l.c/{size}/1016_2.png","created_at":"2017-06-27T14:29:22.710Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eAre these tl;dr topics supposed to go somewhere?
