I‚Äôm evaluating Godot, Atomic, Urho3D, Blender and OpenSceneGraph. I‚Äôm hoping some of you here can help me determine if this engine is a candidate \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e I‚Äôm not ‚Äòhawking‚Äô my game idea, and sincerely hope this is the right sub-forum!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy idea for the app is ‚Äúbuilding and programming your own games - without technical skills‚Äù - along the lines of \u003ca href=\"https://www.roblox.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eRoblox\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.kodugamelab.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eKodu\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.lego.com/en-gb/worlds/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eLego Worlds\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://littlebigplanet.playstation.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eLittleBigPlanet\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://struckd.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eStruckd\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockland_%28video_game%29\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eBlockland\u003c/a\u003e (apparently defunct), \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Spark\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eProject Spark\u003c/a\u003e (defunct).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt will have a simple rule programming language to bring things to life. Aside from the app being Open Source, this language is the main differentiator to these other approaches. It isn‚Äôt text-based, it appears as simple 2D grids expressing rules, that are similar to spreadsheet formulae, and that react to scene object state changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game engine should thus ideally make the following elements nice and easy:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e2D interface panels‚Ä¶\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ewith scrollable selectors, grids holding text items, buttons\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eto choose and configure renderable game objects into scenes\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eto enter and edit the animation rules for those objects\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethat either pop up over the live scenes or appear inside them\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last point in the list above is because the rule editor, rule runner and game loop won‚Äôt be started and stopped, they will run continuously, even as rules are being updated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAPI access to the states of scene objects, to read and write their properties and be notified of events\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epersistence of scene structures and their rules to a database or files\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eaccess to threads and the event loop to give my stuff plenty of CPU\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eeasy API access and C/C++ code extension\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ebuilding to Android and other common platforms\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would strongly prefer to write the rule runner in C, rather than C++. I‚Äôve implemented similar systems in every language known to man, including these three, but C feels like the right low-level language to implement another very high-level language in. This is partly because of speed and resource usage, but also because C is very portable, so I‚Äôd find it easy to port the language to any other hardware or OS, including embedded systems, etc. Having said that, I‚Äôm open to strong arguments in favour of C++.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo my question is, can Urho3D easily support the bullet points above? \u003cimg
