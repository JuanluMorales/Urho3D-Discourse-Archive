Urho3D has support for spriter. Spine is also a popular skeleton animation format and it has runtime in c source code([github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes)). Is there any plan for Urho3D to add support for spine? That will be a great addition.

Sorry, Urho3D has no plan to add supporting of Spine, I think you can add yourself, current AnimationSet2D is flexible, it is easy to add other animation format support.
