Hey guys , 

Is it possible to place the urho suface on top of a page background ? 

I'm using a grid system and i have a background on a page that is beneath the urho application.

I'm using Xaml and i have 2 layout on top of another - however the UrhoSurface/scene has a black background . I'm wondering if its possible to make the main urho container transparent except the models , so that it will look like the models appear on the main page background instead .

The background on the page is continuously changing and its in 2D
