When you stated that making the change to the CMakeLists.txt will fix my error, do you mean it should successfully reach 100% during the make? My current goal is to try and get some of the game samples working on my Pi by natively building.

If that is the case, is there a previous build that has had success when building natively? I have seen a few posts in the past regarding those who have successfully got theirs to work with the sample games.
