I have compiled Urho3D and I completed the \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/wiki/Setting-up-a-Project-(CMake)\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eSetting up a Project\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e tutorial, but I don’t know what to do next.  I just don’t know how a program should be structured.  Even the \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/wiki/First-Project\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eFirst Project\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e tutorial appears to be too much for me at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat should I do to gain programming experience before I’m ready to start a project in Urho?  Is there any theory I should read, or guides I should read about making the base of a C++ application?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy goal is to remake \u003ca href=\"https://gitlab.com/electric-gecko/lipsofsuna\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eLips of Suna\u003c/a\u003e in Urho3D, with a combination of Angelscript and C++.  Lips of Suna is a game project abandoned by it’s creator.  I’m trying to pick it up, but the codebase is too much of a mess even for more skilled programmers, which seems to be stopping potential contributors.  There’s also some performance issues that would likely get resolved with Urho3D.  It uses a custom game engine written in C/C++ using OGRE \u0026amp; Bullet, and scripts are written in Lua in a rather incomprehensible style.  So far, I’ve been getting it to work with OGRE 1.10 and Bullet 2.86.  I’ve pretty much just replaced deprecated functions with new equivalents though, as I couldn’t figure out how make more complex changes to take advantage of new OGRE features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I’ll start with recreating the main menu before writing the game itself, likely using Urho’s UI features.  This must be the easy part, and it’s also what first appears when starting the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only programming that I can currently do comfortably is with Arduino.  However, I have \u003cem\u003esometimes\u003c/em\u003e managed to make little edits to open-source C++ projects, most notably when I tried to \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/LiamM32/qsynth\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eadd a retuning feature to QSynth\u003c/a\u003e (MIDI synthesizer), which didn’t get finished though I got pretty far given my general lack of skills.  I learned Arduino through a high-school class, but the C++ I learned is from online tutorials I have taken since.  I have \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e managed to fix a segmentation fault.  I hope that gives you an idea of where my skills are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I think I need to know now is what the codebase is required to have to make the application to run.  So far I’ve only been modifying existing programs which already had the main() loop or whatever’s needed written, so I don’t know how those parts work.  Although I have a good understanding of math and (sometimes) logic, my struggles in programming come from syntax and the low-level stuff.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-07-30T00:26:30.240Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":118,"reads":52,"readers_count":51,"score":600.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":3373,"topic_slug":"being-inexperienced-what-should-i-do-to-get-ready-to-use-urho3d","display_username":"Liam McGillivray","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":3,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://gitlab.com/electric-gecko/lipsofsuna","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Liam McGillivray / lipsofsuna · GitLab","clicks":25},{"url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/wiki/First-Project","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"First Project · urho3d/Urho3D Wiki · GitHub","clicks":6},{"url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/wiki/Setting-up-a-Project-(CMake)","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Setting up a Project (CMake) · urho3d/Urho3D Wiki · GitHub","clicks":4},{"url":"https://github.com/LiamM32/qsynth","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"GitHub - LiamM32/qsynth","clicks":1}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":773,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":19519,"name":"","username":"slapin","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/dfb087/{size}.png","created_at":"2017-07-21T03:21:39.717Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eBe inspired, read docs and ask questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStart simple with small feature code with small things you want to add.\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter you finish with that and feel stronger with code, plan architecture and ddesign engine for game\u003cbr\u003e\n(Consider Urho as building blocks for your game engine, not complete engine like UE4).\u003cbr\u003e\nImplement features from top to bottom one by one.

However, 0.5.0 may be used more as a reference for the beginning of the project due to having a simpler codebase.
