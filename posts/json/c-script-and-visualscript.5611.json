C++ is not a scripting language.  Granted it \u003cem\u003ecould\u003c/em\u003e in principle be scripted because the language specification doesn‚Äôt preclude it, but I‚Äôm not particularly aware of anyone providing such an implementation of C++.  Maybe it‚Äôs out there, but I‚Äôm unaware of anyone making production use of such a thing, and it‚Äôs certainly not a widespread practice.  Widespread practices are important when expecting things to work in the real world.  Let alone the real world of $0 open source, which is a lot of what Urho is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should also be made aware that unlike C, C++ does not have any standard name mangling.  So getting some \u003cem\u003ecompiled\u003c/em\u003e implementation of C++, to talk to a \u003cem\u003edifferent interpreted\u003c/em\u003e implementation of C++, would be a non-trivial implementation effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I totally understand why the previous replier would freak out.  It‚Äôs like you‚Äôve asked for something that you have no clue how much work, or how brittle or broken it‚Äôs likely to be.  If you have proof of concept otherwise, by all means feel free to provide it.  Pointing at some JavaScript editor for GDevelop doesn‚Äôt mean anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow as Modanung makes reference to, you might be asking for a C++ compiler to ship with Urho3D, and for some kind of build system to come into existence at runtime, to compile C++ code on the fly, in some kind of nice neato nifty integrated way.  Well I have to say‚Ä¶ keeping multiple C++ compilers working in this manner, is a non-trivial amount of work.  Also, some compilers you can‚Äôt just readily ship out with apps.  The GPL stuff, yes you could.  Clang, yep, although I haven‚Äôt kept up with how it does on Windows lately.  Microsoft Visual C++, nope, forget it!  And it‚Äôs a pretty important compiler for game development.  So what are you going to do, get in the business of playing favorites with compiler support?  Sounds like a really bad idea, and very much a complication of development concerns.  Especially given the usual limited $0 resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think it‚Äôs notable that the post Modanung references, is from 5 years ago.
