Hi, 
When I click the menu in the Editor, it's nothing happened.
Would you tell me, how to use "load particle data"?
Thank you.

You must have a ParticleEmitter component selected in the scene hierarchy. The particle XML will be loaded & applied to that component. Save works similarly on the selected ParticleEmitter.

Thank you, cadaver.
It's perfect.
