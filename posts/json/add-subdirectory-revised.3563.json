I don’t have time to study all the build scripts but at a glance I can tell they are definitely different. I spotted a few concerns though. Mostly due to hard-coded path that looks to me to be too *nix specific. If you have followed our GitHub issue tracker then you may already know that I too have planned to rewrite (modernize) our existing build scripts and jump the minimum version to 3.8.2 (to take the advantage of the CMake C++11 compiler feature support). Having said that, I found I have no time nor energy/health/stamina to keep going or simply because I chose to pursuing other thing that interests me more in my free time. So, I will encourage you to continue what you have started. Who knows you can make your build system works for all the Urho3D supported platforms sooner or better than me.
