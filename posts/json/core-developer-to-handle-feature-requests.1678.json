I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be appropriate to assign feature requests, nor to have someone specifically assigned to address them. Rather, feel free to fulfill feature requests as you see fit and let the community react accordingly. It‚Äôs going to save you a big headache (nobody‚Äôs EXPECTING you to fulfill feature requests), and everyone a big headache if you won‚Äôt/can‚Äôt do something. Ideally a community like this would work together to bring the features that we want/need, and we don‚Äôt want a bottleneck by any means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever we should always welcome people who are offering to help.
