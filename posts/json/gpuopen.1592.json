So, absent personal enthusiasm, it would probably be a lot of work and risk for Urho’s 2 core developers to take on, I reckon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenerally what worries me in the health and success of any open source 3d engine, is the development of an \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003eecology\u003c/span\u003e, not more technology.  By that I mean, demos, samples, and even complete games that actually work.  Developers who stay in the orbit of the engine and continue to keep things working, rather than moving on to something else.  Several years ago I did a serious evaluation of Ogre3D.  I went through their entire website building every single project that was listed as an “Ogre based project”.  Lots of them didn’t work anymore and I moved them all to an “inactive projects” page.  By the time I finished that the body count was high.  The actual ecology of Ogre was a lot smaller than it had looked.  It demonstrated some kind of heydey where people were doing a lot of stuff, but then somehow drifted away and left things to bitrot.  Maybe the Ogre APIs changed enough that people didn’t want to do the work.  Maybe Ogre was too slow to adopt newer 3D APIs, particularly DX11.  Heck they only claimed to have done that \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003ethis year\u003c/span\u003e which I think is pretty sad really.  I think I did that website cleanup 3 years ago, and I remember someone was just sorta getting started with DX11 back then.  Reading their forums, I remember a lot of anti forward movement energy, that they weren’t going to take on newer APIs “just because”.  I’m guessing their heyday probably followed a fairly predictable curve of when DX9 was strongest.  2015 is pretty late to be getting on with DX11 frankly.  We’ve got DX12 now to say “won’t take on a newer API ‘just because’…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyways back then I ditched Ogre.  I’d done my due diligence, and I left a clean kitchen for the next guy trying to figure out the same thing.  That was disheartening because at the time, Ogre seemed to be the best that pure open source had to offer.  Their major strategic mistake IMO was insisting on being a 3d rendering engine, not a 3d game engine.  So they wouldn’t bless any particular scripting language for instance.  You can’t maintain a developer ecology without one, people just don’t want to do heavy duty game development only in C++.  Things like Lua bindings would be maintained 3rd party.  As they’d amount to 1 guy working on it, that 1 guy would eventually get bored, and the binding would bitrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems Ogre will stay that way, because the monetization model has become incorporating it into commercial game engines.  Like that guy who ran off and did NeoAxis.  Well at least he had all that motivation to do the integration work, the potential of money at the end of the rainbow, but it doesn’t help pure open source any.  Pure open source is capable of accomplishing quite a lot, but it does require people to evaluate and work towards \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003esustainable \u003c/span\u003eproject directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m guessing that GPUOpen is not a sustainable ambition for Urho3D.  A highly motivated individual could always prove me wrong.  Just remember that boredom is always the enemy.  You think you have all this time to do things in open source… well you don’t.  You will eventually get bored.  You have to accomplish exciting, sustainable things \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003ebefore \u003c/span\u003eyou get bored.

They work on their own priorities.  They can do a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e of work on something if they’re really into it.  Good volunteer leaders get out of the way of people like that, to see what they can gain from their enthusiasm.  Bad leaders say “no.”  So the point is, if it’s your enthusiasm, run with it!  But don’t expect others to just run with it, whatever “it” is, just because you’re enthused.  They probably have other things they’re enthused about, that are commanding and sucking away their energies.

I don’t know that I do.  It depends on what is possible on such machines, as well as what is scaleable.  I have a large erstwhile 3d optimization jock side to me.  Once upon a time I wrote OpenGL driver code for money.  Beating other vendors on Viewperf and GLPerf and all that.  A slower machine, is a good indicator for whether you’re making progress with optimization.  With anything meaningful, you should see results.  And if not then of course you’re wasting your time.  Anything less than 20% benchmarked improvement is a waste of time in my experience, just noise.  You can run all sorts of tests for a few days, it can take a lot of time.  Got nice spreadsheet, better see some results for all that testing.  It’s generally faster to understand how your HW works and just wing it with your best guess how to improve things.
