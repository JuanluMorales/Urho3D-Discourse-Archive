I do not understand how Discord serves that purpose in any way.  I’ve never looked up an answer on Discord.  I’ve never seen an answer on Discord be visible to the internet writ large.  From a sharing technical information standpoint, I think Discord is a black hole.  And I think when people just talk, and don’t \u003cem\u003elook up\u003c/em\u003e stuff, then they tend towards incompetence at solving open source problems and building for the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis view of mine is somewhat colored by a non-technical forum I participate in on Reddit, where people just ask the same questions over and over and over again, even though the answers have already been given hundreds of times in the archives.  It’s getting so old for me now, that I simply don’t want to help noobs anymore in that forum.  Or it very much depends on my mood, which can be a prelude to just signing off and letting people fend for themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realize that Discord probably accomplishes a \u003cem\u003esocial\u003c/em\u003e purpose, and that that has value.  But for a \u003cem\u003etechnical\u003c/em\u003e purpose, it looks like a poor resource to me.  And I echo other people’s concerns, about having more discussion venues than are currently needed or best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually I can’t think of \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e internet chat medium that has ever provided a useful technical answer for me.  Except the time I wanted to rescue my Yahoo! mailing list from imminent destruction.  A chat happened to be the way to get info straight from the horse’s mouth, about which archiving tool actually worked.
