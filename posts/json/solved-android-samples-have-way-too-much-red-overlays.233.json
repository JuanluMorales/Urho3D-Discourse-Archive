However whenever I tried to run the samples, the colors are way too much red that it’s hard to see the objects. As for the second problem, whenever a sample is run, the running sample seems to can’t go back to the main menu. The only way for me to run another example is by forcefully stop the running example and to start the samples all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI compiled Urho3D and the samples against Android API 14 (Android 4.0, target ID 7). The testing hardware is Galaxy Note 10.1 (Android 4.1.2).
