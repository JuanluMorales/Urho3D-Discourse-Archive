A common idiom of mine was to populate a variant map with data, then fire off an event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003elocal vm=VariantMap()\nvm:SetBool(\"flag\", true)\nvm:SetVector3(\"pos\", Vector3(1,1,1))\nself.node:SendEvent(\"Event\", vm)\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe change to Lua variant map indexing broke this idiom, so this morning I went through and made the changes:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003elocal vm=VariantMap()\nvm[\"flag\"]=true\nvm[\"pos\"]=Vector3(1,1,1)\nself.node:SendEvent(\"Event\", vm)\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, something has broken and I am not sure exactly what it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a component, written in C++, that performs a task of broadcasting an “AreYouReady” type of event, and any objects signed up to receive the event will send back a reply by populating a variant map with their node ID and sending off another event. The scheduler component listens for this event and inserts ready objects into a vector for later processing. Before the change to the variant map indexing, this was functioning as intended, but now it no longer is. The C++ component is essentially structured as so:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003e// Turn scheduler\nTurnScheduler::TurnScheduler(Context *context) : LogicComponent(context)\n{\n\tSetUpdateEventMask(USE_UPDATE);\n\t\n\tSubscribeToEvent(StringHash(\"RegisterReadyObject\"), HANDLER(TurnScheduler, HandleRegisterReadyObject));\n}\n\nvoid TurnScheduler::Update(float dt)\n{\n\tSendEvent(CombatRequestStatus, vm);\n}\nvoid TurnScheduler::HandleRegisterReadyObject(StringHash eventType, VariantMap\u0026amp; eventData)\n{\n\tstatic StringHash ReadyID(\"ReadyID\");\n\t\n\tunsigned int id=eventData[ReadyID].GetUInt();\n\tstd::cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \"Ready object: \" \u0026lt;\u0026lt; id \u0026lt;\u0026lt; std::endl;\n\t// Add object to Ready vector\n}\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObjects then have a LuaScriptObject class that will subscribe to the CombatRequestStatus event, and fire off a RegisterReadyObject event if they are ready:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003eCombatCommandQueue=ScriptObject()\n\nfunction CombatCommandQueue:Start()\n\t\n\tself:SubscribeToEvent(\"CombatRequestStatus\", \"CombatCommandQueue:HandleRequestStatus\")\n\tself.ready=true\n\t\nend\n\nunction CombatCommandQueue:HandleRequestStatus(eventType, eventData)\n\tif self.ready then\n\t\tprint(\"Sending ready for \"..self.node:GetID())\n\t\tself.vm[\"ReadyID\"]=self.node:GetID()\n\t\tself.node:SendEvent(\"RegisterReadyObject\", self.vm)\n\tend\nend\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogging indicates that the HandleRequestStatus event is being received. However, when the RegisterReadyObject event is fired off, it is not being received by the turn scheduler anymore. I’ve experimented with populating the variant map with string hashes rather than strings:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003eself.vm[StringHash(\"ReadyID\")=self.node:GetID()\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand with sending a string hash of the RegisterReadyObject event instead of a regular string:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003eself.node:SendEvent(StringHash(\"RegisterReadyObject\"), self.vm)\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebut to no avail.

Had you joined the discussion earlier or helped me to fix those missing bindings at the beginning, perhaps I would not have touched the LuaScript subsystem at all.  \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\"\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I totally agree that the “mismatch” between Lua (at least on version 5.1) and C++ (at least on our Variant class) is an inconvenience and error prone. The idea of removing those setter methods in the VariantMap.pkg is to avoid having duplicate codes (this is one of the thing I can’t stand). But in doing so, I have also realized early on that the _newindex metamethod would have problem assigning Lua number to Variant as non-double. I believe you have spotted my code comment and/or code to do special handling for LUA_TNUMBER. But at that time, I thought the problem is not serious enough. I thought code from C++ side could first prep the VariantMap by associating a certain key with a Variant value storing a default integral or floating data type value. Then on the Lua side, the _newindex metamethod would use that initial type as cue to cast the LUA_TNUMBER accordingly preserving the intial integral or floating data type. Obviously this won’t work in your case because the event and hence the VariantMap is originated from Lua side, so there is no way for you to prep this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncidentally this is also an existing problem for Variant constructors in Lua side. If you do “local test = Variant(100)” then you will always get a Variant storing a double. This happens because the double constructor overload declared later than the integer one in the Variant.pkg and thus it is being considered first. That’s how tolua++ works (I just figure out that recently, don’t ask me why). Interchange the order won’t solve the problem because if integer constructor overload is being considered first then “local test = Variant(100.123)” would always get a Variant storing an integer instead. In other words, these constructor overloads are stepping on each other’s toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003e    Variant(int value);\n    Variant(unsigned value);\n    Variant(float value);\n    Variant(double value);\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last one declared wins. I am mentioning this not to shift the focus on the VariantMap problem, but just to strengthen the point that we do have an inherent mismatch problem between Lua/number and C++/Variant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI propose to solve it this way. Remove those Variant constructors above (or perhaps just keep the double version around). Then bind setter methods to Variant class in Lua side similar to what Variant used to have. Something like: SetInt(i), SetUInt(u), SetFloat(f), SetDouble(d). We can also add a generic Set(“typename”, i/u/f/d), where typename is one of “int”, “unsigned”, “float”, “double”. So, back to your case, you can write something like: vm[“ReadyID”]:SetUInt(self.node:GetID())\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":4,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:06:37.006Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":1,"reads":6,"readers_count":5,"score":6.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":1282,"topic_slug":"broken-lua-events","display_username":"Yao Wei Tjong","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://discourse.urho3d.io/t/odbcc-database-connectivity/1188/16","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"ODBCC / Database connectivity - Feature Request - Urho3D","clicks":1},{"url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/820","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Improve Lua binding for Variant and VariantMap classes · Issue #820 · urho3d/Urho3D · GitHub","clicks":1}],"read":true,"user_title":"Admin","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":4,"hidden":false,"trust_level":4,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":7339,"name":"","username":"JTippetts","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/jtippetts/{size}/357_2.png","created_at":"2015-08-21T12:55:56.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eDon’t worry about me having to fix stuff.
