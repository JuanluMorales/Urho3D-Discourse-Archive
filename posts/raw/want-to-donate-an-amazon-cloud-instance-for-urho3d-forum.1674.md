Hi all!

I have been working with Urho3D for a while now, and want to help out the project in some way. I have noticed that there are adds coming up on every page load of the forum. I can donate a virtual server on Amazon cloud to the project to be used for hosting the forum. What do you think?

PS: I can also donate money on a regular basis to pay for an Amazon cloud hosted forum = )

It's pretty straightforward to migrate a PHPBB-based forum to another host. I can help with the migration process, if needed.

I second this solely for the fact that prophpbb tends to be unreliable.
