Then multiply it with a cavity map or baked ambient occlusion or some post-process AO effect. It’s one of those things where many kinds of games have their own way of doing ambient lighting with advantages and trade-offs for each kind of technique. UnrealEngine4 is using light propagation volumes as far as I know to keep things dynamic with indirect lights for instance and would work with instancing, and same for Crysis and other modern engines. Then it’s getting reflections to work that are not just flat surfaces like water which is the new one to solve (screen-space local reflections + cubemap fallbacks seem to be the trend now, and voxel cone tracing is still not ready for mainstream yet). Or there might be hybrid raytracing approaches which might be the trend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheers\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":5,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T00:58:43.817Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":3,"readers_count":2,"score":0.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":184,"topic_slug":"character-is-flat-in-shadow","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":69,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":1037,"name":"","username":"friesencr","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/friesencr/{size}/827_2.png","created_at":"2014-04-03T04:56:38.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eI just bake my ao in the color map \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/open_mouth.png?v=5\" title=\":open_mouth:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":open_mouth:\"\u003e and enjoy me some mid 2000s quality graphics with a ton more vertices \\m/  It seems like my gtx 780 can handle 100 million verts of static models without a drop.
