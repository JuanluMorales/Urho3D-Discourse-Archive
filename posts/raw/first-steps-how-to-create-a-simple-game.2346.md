Hi everyone,

I just installed Urho3D on Raspberry Pi successfully, and now I can run the examples perfectly.

I searched for a tutorial for the very first steps of creating a project, but I didn't find one.
I opened the Editor.sh program, but I don't know how to use it!
So I hope you can help me here:

I want to design a very simple game: rotate object by keyboard keys.

So, I think this would be my list:

1. How to create a project?
2. How to import ready 3D models?
3. How to set a camera?
4. How to define keyboard keys for rotation of the 3D object?
5. How to extract executable game file?

I know that these questions are kind of silly and basic, but I'm a beginner in this without tutorial.
So your help and support would be highly appreciated.

1. How to create a project?

I suppose that you simply link to the generated library from the 'lib' folder ([i]something like libUrho3D.so.a[/i]). And point your compiler to the generated include folder. It all depends on how you've built it, if you're using some IDE. You can start by looking at the hello world example from the `Samples` directory. There's really not much to say here. Once you've built it you should be required to know how to handle third party headers and libraries.

Unless... you mean a project into the editor. In which case there's no such thing. You just create scenes that you can load from your code.

You can use the provided [url=https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_tools.html]command line asset converter/importer[/url]. Or simply use the provided editor which should've been built alongside the engine.

Again, check out the examples and/or the documentation. You can learn a lot from there.

I'm not sure I really understand this. Unless you've never been initialized to how compilers work. In which case, there's not really much to be done here.

Or maybe you mean some executable generated by the editor. Which again, not something that the editor does. There's a '[url=https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_running.html]player[/url]' so to speak which you can tell it to run a certain script in the command line if you've used scripting instead of C++.

Again, check out the [url=https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/]documentation[/url], check out the examples from the `Samples` directory in the `Source` folder if you're using C++ or their script version from the `bin/Data/Scripts` directory. And the rest should be straight forward.
