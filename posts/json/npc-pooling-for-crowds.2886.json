So it should not be spawned out of sudden. Also, NPCs should be dynamic\u003cbr\u003e\nso as time passes they change their occupation and location, and this location should be logical, i.e.\u003cbr\u003e\nlike leave work at 18:00, get in car and go home, and anywhere on path NPC could be intercepted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I think is that when player is distant, NPCs at locations are randomly spawn, as they are far from NPC,\u003cbr\u003e\nthe low-poly version is spawn, which does distant-behavior (simplified, just motion or idling or some\u003cbr\u003e\noccupation animations like phone talking), no IK or physics or navmesh applied. All actions are according to place or spawn point. As player comes closer, the motion becomes physics-based, navmesh is used for reference, IK is applied for some animations like walking, interaction is possible between player and NPCs and between NPCs, behavior becomes complex and models are replaced by high-poly versions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eif player follows NPC, he can get for all his scedule. Other NPCs use standard spawning/removing.\u003cbr\u003e\nI donâ€™t understand yet how to handle this, but I think this should be possible, probably keeping track of a set of closest NPCs and never remove them. So there should be some distance where NPCs are collected and spawned and inside this zone no collection and spawn should happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny suggestions on how I could implement this? Which Urho features can be used?\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-03-12T18:04:50.045Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":12,"reads":28,"readers_count":27,"score":65.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":2886,"topic_slug":"npc-pooling-for-crowds","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":554,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false}],"stream":[16546]},"timeline_lookup":[[1,2081]],"suggested_topics":[{"id":7180,"title":"Adding
