Looking at the lines around the colored text portion it appears that the lines are areas of \"off glyph\" texture that's bleeding through.\n\nIf you can get a dump of the rasterized font I'd look at that and compare it to the offending characters to see if there's any stand out indicators (ie. maybe the font rasterize only writes alpha where it thinks it needs to instead of everywhere).\n\nThen I'd look at whoever/where-ever the font is rendered into an image (as in turning a TTF into a bitmap).\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then you said this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eI haven't started digging into this yet, as I have no idea where to look, but I can start with diff'ing the UIBatch render process.\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is that: “I have no idea where to look” … I gave you a detailed list of exactly where I’d look.
