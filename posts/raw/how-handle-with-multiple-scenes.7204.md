How can I handle with multiple scenes?

Raylib and GameMaker can use cases and switches, can I do same here? Or maybe make a scene list, each one a header/source file, loaded by one header/source file, then just loading when needed (jump maps).

I'm planning to create a 2.5D side-scroller rpg game, I'll need to use this too much.
