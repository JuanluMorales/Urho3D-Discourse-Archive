I need to make a mapping tool with Urho, but I have no idea where to start. I'm feeling fairly confident that it's possible, even only using AngelScript, but I have no clue how to do it. So my questions is: How do I make a mapping tool similar to TrenchBroom using Urho? I don't know C++, only AngelScript so that might make it harder. but still do-able correct?

Looks like the source for TrenchBroom is on Github, so that's a good place to start. Familiarize yourself with the source, and then figure out which parts you will have to modify/rewrite to interface with Urho3D. And it should be doable with AngelScript. The Urho3D editor is currently written in AS, after all.

I'll try that, but I'm not very good with code. I am going to have to get more familiar with this stuff eventually though. Any tips for a newbie like myself?

Definitely check out @Enhex 's project. It's an old style fps with quake-style level editor.
