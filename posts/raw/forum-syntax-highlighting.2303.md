Can we get some syntax highlighting going for code snippets? The green text is kind of hard to read sometimes.

This one is pretty good:

Since this is shared hosting I don't think you could make such a request. 

gist works great and you can also keep it in your gist stash (aka github account). See my shader codes in code exchange for reference.

I could post a short guide if you need some help on that.

I think there is some chance that there is a tampermonkey/greasemonkey javascript to syntax-highlight page elements.
