I first discovered it on FreeGameDev forums in summer 2014, about a month before Amuzen left and never returned.  It has a custom game engine using OGRE for graphics, and scripts are in LuaJIT.  Although I have wanted to develop it further, I have been limited in what I can do due to my very limited coding skills.  Worse; being an abandoned project with a custom game engine, I get very little support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, I have recently managed to update the engine to make it work with OGRE 1.10 and Bullet 2.86.1, which I uploaded to \u003ca href=\"https://gitlab.com/electric-gecko/lipsofsuna\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ethis repository\u003c/a\u003e.  The forum has become more active since I started doing this, although I’m still the only person who has been touching the code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOriginally suggested \u003ca href=\"https://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=65\u0026amp;t=7487\u0026amp;p=73576\u0026amp;hilit=+Update+to+support+OGRE#p73576\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eby a moderator on the forum\u003c/a\u003e, I would now like to have Lips of Suna remade with Urho3D.  Here are the main reasons:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe current version has performance issues which would likely be fixed with this.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe current codebase of Lips of Suna is too messy, making it hard to develop further and scaring off potential contributors.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCan’t get any support for the Lips of Suna game engine, as it’s exclusive to this project and the developer has left.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScripts can be written in Angelscript.  This should give better performance, as the Lua garbage collector seems to cause big frame-rate drops when it activates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have tried to create an Urho3D program, using the tutorials and the HelloGUI sample for reference.  But I haven’t figured out how to get it working, as my programming skills are very limited.  I have taken online tutorials for the syntax of C++, but I have never written a main loop before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be very nice if someone else to were to start writing the new game engine.  As I have struggled to do this first part myself, I’ll likely have to join-in after this first step is done (or started).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the current Lips of Suna, the main funtion is in “src/lipsofsuna/main/main.c”.  But in Urho3D, doesn’t the main function have to be in C++?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA good first milestone would be to replicate the game’s main menu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy vision of what Lips of Suna should become is something in-between version 0.5.0 \u0026amp; 0.8.0 (latest stable version).  I never got to play 0.5.0, only watched a video of it. It was made for an old Ubuntu version pre-12.04, so I couldn’t compile it.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-07-30T00:24:34.576Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":116,"reads":64,"readers_count":63,"score":592.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":3396,"topic_slug":"help-remaking-lips-of-suna-engine-with-urho3d","display_username":"Liam McGillivray","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://gitlab.com/electric-gecko/lipsofsuna","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Liam McGillivray / lipsofsuna","clicks":19},{"url":"https://forum.freegamedev.net/viewforum.php?f=25\u0026sid=5ef6f3855ca4c639e201cc617f7a6958","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Forum - Lips of Suna • Lips of Suna • FreeGameDev Forums - Open Source Game Development","clicks":15},{"url":"https://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=65\u0026t=7487\u0026p=73576\u0026hilit=+Update+to+support+OGRE#p73576","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Topic - Update to support OGRE 1.10 \u0026 Bullet 2.86 • LoS Modding \u0026 Contributions • FreeGameDev Forums - Open Source Game Development","clicks":2},{"url":"http://discourse.urho3d.io/t/being-inexperienced-what-should-i-do-to-get-ready-to-use-urho3d/3373/14","internal":true,"reflection":true,"title":"Being inexperienced, what should I do to get ready to use Urho3D","clicks":1}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":773,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":19701,"name":"","username":"Victor","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/v/3e96dc/{size}.png","created_at":"2017-07-30T00:54:06.708Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eUrho kinda hides the main function.
