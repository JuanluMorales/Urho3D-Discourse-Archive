I came across the following devblog:

And i'm super curious about the technology behind this. Is this a specific IK algorithm? Or a mix of a lot of stuff? Can someone point me to a few articles? Thanks for the help identifying this.

Doesn't look to be IK, strongly looks like a learning/evo based motors system.

[Muscle Based Bipeds](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~rickl/courses/cs-271/lit/2013-TOG-MuscleBasedBipeds.pdf), follow the references for more material.

[Locomotion Skills for Simulated Quadrupeds](www.cs.ubc.ca/~van/papers/2011-TOG-quadruped/paper.pdf), might be more digestible and a bit less esoteric.

There's a metric ton of these things floating around based on ODE.
