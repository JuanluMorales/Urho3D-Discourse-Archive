It’s core idea is setting transform ranges for bones, mapping them to tendons and using normalized values to control these. This should allow for clenching a fist or posing the spine with a handful of characters, as well as sign language. The range and tendon mappings would be in red PiRMIT, which should also be able to define/generate the rig and mesh.
