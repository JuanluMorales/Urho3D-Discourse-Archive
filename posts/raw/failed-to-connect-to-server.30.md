When running example '17_SceneReplication' I get the following log:

INFO: Connecting to server localhost:2345
ERROR: Failed to connect to server

I've tried on Linux, Windows and Android and still get the same error.

You need to run two instancies of this application: server and client.

Many thanks for quick reply.
