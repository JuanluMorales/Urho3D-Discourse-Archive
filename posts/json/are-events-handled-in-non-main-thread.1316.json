It might actually lose textures etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasicly I am doing something like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003e\n\t// clear old map, remove children\n\tUrho3D::Node* sceneNode = scene_-\u0026gt;GetChild(\"scene\", true);\n\tif (sceneNode)\n\t\tsceneNode-\u0026gt;GetParent()-\u0026gt;RemoveAllChildren();\n\n\n\tResourceCache* cache = GetSubsystem\u0026lt;ResourceCache\u0026gt;();\n\n\t// Technically add same nodes from xml-file.\n\tXMLFile* file = cache-\u0026gt;GetResource\u0026lt;XMLFile\u0026gt;(\"newmap.xml\");\n\tscene_-\u0026gt;InstantiateXML(file-\u0026gt;GetRoot(\"scene\"), Urho3D::Vector3::ZERO, Quaternion());\n\n\tmap_-\u0026gt;GenerateMapFromScene(scene_-\u0026gt;GetChild(\"Map\", true));\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso inside generatemap, I am going through the vertexbuffer-data. The resourcecache might somehow cause some weirdness when I am deleting stuff from scene, and basically instantly adding same stuff few lines later, which is not that good idea. Anyways I will try to isolate the crash a bit better tomorrow and hopefully manage to reproduce it with smaller amount of code. It could just be my horrible spaghetti code somewhere leaking memory/pointers pointing to unreached memory and causing tons of problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not even sure which systems are using extra threads, but it seems the crashes are mostly happening from worker threads, . Also the problem is, that this doesn’t happen on every execution, it just sometimes happens or crashes in various ways.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:06:46.777Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":3,"reads":5,"readers_count":4,"score":16.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":1316,"topic_slug":"are-events-handled-in-non-main-thread","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":205,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":7467,"name":"Lasse Öörni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2015-08-31T13:59:39.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eIf you don’t especially request it by using the async scene load functionality, the resources aren’t loaded threaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrashes in the worker threads could however easily appear during scene rendering, if the scene has become corrupt, e.g. dangling pointers to deleted objects, and the rendering preparations executed on the WorkQueue, like culling, tries to access these objects.

I exported blender scene by assetimporter and this one creates node that has an attribute name called “Scene” and I was loading  -objects from xml. Basically I only wanted to instantiate the node that had attribute name “Scene” and sub nodes of it.
