Nothing fancy but just did some scene tweaking with default water by changing color and adding my custom color ramping shader and gamma correct.

Yes, we're still working on that one. Honestly, it would be a nice thing to have like a port or something similar of Ogre3D HydraX/SkyX to Urho3D. :wink:

Thanks codingmonkey :slight_smile: I might have a better version of water but still needs some heavy tweaking. I will try to post an update soon.
