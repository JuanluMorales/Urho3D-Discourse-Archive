Hello,

Do anyone know how exactly the window focusing works?

I have [i.imgur.com/2hdR14D.png](http://i.imgur.com/2hdR14D.png)

Someone was working on a PBR lighting shader??

I want to click a specific window and have it show on top.  Additionally, possibly add a auto-update on windows specifically ones that deal with object interaction. Shown is the interact component  and interactUI events working.  The code is still open for additional help. 

Another note, I need a additional programmer. Since most of the majority coding now required is adding logic. I posted some ads on reddit dev game classiields for other help from modellers to writers hoping to get a modeller soon.
