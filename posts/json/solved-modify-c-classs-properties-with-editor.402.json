Can this be done if I want to use C++ instead of AngelScript?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don‚Äôt really understand when and how should I use C++ or one of the scripting languages. It appears most of the game can be done by scripting: Is there a huge performance issue with that? There are some elements of my game logic that are part of the game‚Äôs core and I feel more appropriate to do those in C++, do I lose the possibility to edit its parameters in the editor if done like that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, how can I set up a custom subsystem in the editor itself so the scripts running in it can reference this subsystem and call its methods? Would I need to edit the editor‚Äôs code to do that, or is it already implemented?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you!  \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=5\" title=\":smiley:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":smiley:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:00:10.836Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":19,"reads":7,"readers_count":6,"score":98.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":402,"topic_slug":"solved-modify-c-classs-properties-with-editor","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":125,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":2176,"name":"Lasse √ñ√∂rni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2014-08-27T20:30:48.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eTo edit C++ objects in the editor, you need to define attributes for them, like the inbuilt classes (Node, Light etc.) do. Look for the inbuilt classes for reference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo run custom subsystems in the editor, you can make your own version of Urho3DPlayer (it‚Äôs very simple, it just loads a script and executes its Start() function) that instantiates your subsystem(s) and registers their script API, then runs the editor script. This ties to the first answer: when you have custom C++ objects you want to edit, their object factories \u0026amp; attributes should be registered before running the editor. For reference, look at the functions like RegisterSceneLibrary() in Scene.cpp, which are called by the Engine during initialization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor performance, it depends on each case. For example if you run the HugeObjectCount example in both C++ \u0026amp; script you‚Äôll see that rotating 50000 nodes in script is much slower than rotating them in C++.
