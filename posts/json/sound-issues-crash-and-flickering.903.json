But I think we would need to directly manipulate (aka smooth out) the sound buffer because those “cuts” in the 44100 Hz sound output created by volume changes are creating the clicks and not that we are not updating our volume/frequency often enough. In fact, it should help to make less changes per second. With making a volume change 60 times per second we create up to 60 clicks per second (depending on the height of the jump of the sound curve). If Urho would only update the sound ten times per second, we could only get up to ten clicks.\u003cbr\u003e\nThough this is no real fix since there are still clicks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeems like the only real fix is to smooth out the sound buffer. I think typically applications use a 10ms to 30ms sound buffer. It should be theoretically possible to smooth out all changes there that are too steep. Maybe with an additional thread. 60FPS means that every frame lasts ~16ms. Depending on the buffer size and the frame rate that would be enough to smooth once every frame.
