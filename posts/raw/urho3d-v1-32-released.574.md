Urho3D V1.32 is finally out, tagged and packaged at SourceForge. Thanks to all contributors for the hard work!

Release announcement: [url]http://urho3d.github.io/releases/2014/11/22/urho3d-1.32-release.html[/url]
GitHub source package: [url]https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/archive/1.32.zip[/url]
SourceForge files folder: [url]https://sourceforge.net/projects/urho3d/files/Urho3D/1.32/[/url]

I believe this represents the longest changelog we ever had, though it may also be due to practically listing every new feature, instead of just the absolute "highlights". Enjoy!

Maybe a good idea to post an update announcement on a few sites like IndieDB, GameDev.net, Reddit /r/gamedev, socials ?
