This is so that we can repeat the runway lines as many times as is appropriate for the runway length.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, when you are taking off or landing (looking parallel to the runway), the runway lines smear terribly on the parts of this quad that are further away from you, and it’s not subtle.   It’s awful looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs there some simple fix for this?  This is using the simple Diffuse texture shader (nothing else).  It only happens when we tile the texture across this one quad in V-axis (while U-axis is non-repeating, as it’s just the runway from side-to-side).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/2X/b/b01a984e04ad0add23813e0c2a80c54f8ed8ef1d.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"p7T0SzlHpdwjsZ2GuFD15ZEVF6J\" width=\"336\" height=\"377\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur Diffuse texture looks like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/2X/b/b82bcb3ac7b7c9ae3dcc6d856b4457630de39e23.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"qhfGjtMqbeclAdV6SvxIG4dBIfF\" width=\"278\" height=\"274\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this behavior is “normal” (inescapable), then I supposed we can just complexify-the-mesh, giving every runway segment it’s own Quad.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2021-07-18T05:33:44.234Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":1,"reads":27,"readers_count":26,"score":10.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":6927,"topic_slug":"smeared-tiled-texture-when-looking-parallel-to-it","display_username":"Brian Knox","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1334,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":43160,"name":"Brian Knox","username":"najak3d","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/n/6a8cbe/{size}.png","created_at":"2021-07-18T05:56:23.676Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThis type of defect also happens when not repeating…    I think I understand why this is working this way… as it gets further way, the pixel-size in the V-direction gets miniscule, while the U-direction pixel size really hasn’t shrunk much.   But since the V-direction is so compressed, this is what triggers the graphics card to use a very low rez texture LOD, and therefore it blurs it just as badly along the U-direction as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I’m guessing this is a common defect for many situations where you are looking at a ground texture.  As the ground is eye-level but further from the camera, texture will blur not just in the Up/down-direction, but also equally as blurred along the side-to-side direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d like to avoid this, and not sure if there is a special trick that can be used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote, when looking at the runway more perpendicular (e.g. a top view) - it works just fine.  This only happens when you are landing or taking off, and your view is parallel to the runway itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere’s another view of the runway, after we got rid of the V-Repeating – here I have one Quad for each Line Segment – there is no texture tiling here, yet we’re still facing nearly the same defect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/2X/8/8ed181750dd6f770021300ad68e47bf7b503e98b.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/knqFd1JxvzoDvJcZ6urGHNBvuWf.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/optimized/2X/8/8ed181750dd6f770021300ad68e47bf7b503e98b_2_690x339.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"knqFd1JxvzoDvJcZ6urGHNBvuWf\" width=\"690\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/optimized/2X/8/8ed181750dd6f770021300ad68e47bf7b503e98b_2_690x339.png, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/2X/8/8ed181750dd6f770021300ad68e47bf7b503e98b.png 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/2X/8/8ed181750dd6f770021300ad68e47bf7b503e98b.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/optimized/2X/8/8ed181750dd6f770021300ad68e47bf7b503e98b_2_10x10.png\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"meta\"\u003e\n\u003csvg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\u003e\u003cuse xlink:href=\"#far-image\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cspan class=\"filename\"\u003eimage\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"informations\"\u003e750×369 29.7 KB\u003c/span\u003e\u003csvg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\u003e\u003cuse xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2021-07-18T05:57:11.884Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":27,"readers_count":26,"score":10.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":6927,"topic_slug":"smeared-tiled-texture-when-looking-parallel-to-it","display_username":"Brian Knox","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/2X/8/8ed181750dd6f770021300ad68e47bf7b503e98b.png","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"8ed181750dd6f770021300ad68e47bf7b503e98b.png","clicks":0}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1334,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":43161,"name":"Kai","username":"WangKai","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/wangkai/{size}/821_2.png","created_at":"2021-07-18T06:03:44.990Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eYou could try to enable this -\u003c/p\u003e\u003caside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\" data-onebox-src=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/pc-graphics-options-explained/3/\"\u003e\n  \u003cheader class=\"source\"\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/309297/favicon.ico\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\"\u003e\n\n      \u003ca href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/pc-graphics-options-explained/3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\" title=\"05:48PM - 13 March 2019\"\u003epcgamer – 13 Mar 19\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/header\u003e\n\n  \u003carticle class=\"onebox-body\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:690/388;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4erwdeJ3zkiSB4Ba5SCSa5-1200-80.jpg\" class=\"thumbnail\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/pc-graphics-options-explained/3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\u003ePC graphics options explained\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n  \u003cp\u003eUnderstand what graphics options mean, and which to choose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n  \u003c/article\u003e\n\n  \u003cdiv class=\"onebox-metadata\"\u003e\n    \n    \n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\n  \u003cdiv style=\"clear: both\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs an example, create a xml file with the same name of your diffuse texture, and to add extra filter information to the texture.
