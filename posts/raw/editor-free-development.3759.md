Does anyone else rely entirely on code to make your games (ie no editor)? Is that a common practice?

What conventions/style do you use?

I didn't make games, but I was experimenting without Editor.

I think yes.

Maybe I don't understand the question. Style is similar to any Urho sample.

[heXon](https://github.com/LucKeyProductions/heXon/) and [Quatter](https://github.com/LucKeyProductions/Quatter/) were made without editor.
But [KO](https://github.com/LucKeyProductions/KO/), [Blip 'n Blup](https://github.com/LucKeyProductions/BlipNBlup/) and [OGTatt](https://github.com/LucKeyProductions/OGTatt/) will need [Edddy](https://github.com/LucKeyProductions/Edddy/).

Evolving mess. Starting out with a [custom template](https://github.com/LucKeyProductions/QtCreatorUrho3DWizards) for QtCreator.
