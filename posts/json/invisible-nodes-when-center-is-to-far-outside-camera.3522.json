The model is big enough to be seen inside the camera, and as you would expect, it gets rendered in the scene and all is fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, if I move the nodes centre a bit further away the model disappear from the scene. The model is still big enough to be visible in the scene, but for some reason it just disappear as soon as its position moves it “too far” away. It is moved outside, to the left or right so to speak, and not further into the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess there is some optimisation going on, and that the SetViewport has part in it, but as the model should be visible in my scene, I do not want it to be optimized away \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs there some parameter I should adjust?
