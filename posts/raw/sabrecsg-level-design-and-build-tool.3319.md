I downloaded this sometime early this year and just discovered it on my drive - https://github.com/sabresaurus/SabreCSG
It's MIT license.

It appears to work in unity only...
on my part, I'm learning to use [sverchok](https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok)
it a bit tough, given my poor 3d background, but I'm improving...

I think one thing @Lumak meant by saying its MIT licensed is that it could be modified to work with Urho.
