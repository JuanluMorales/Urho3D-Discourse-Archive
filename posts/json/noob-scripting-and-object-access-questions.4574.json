So far I am leaning toward Urho3D.  However, I am growing more convinced I will need to rewrite part of the engine so that it will work with my project (I would need to do the same with Panda).  I have a few basic questions about object access.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe basic problem with this engine when it comes to my project is security.  I know this may sound a bit strange for a graphics engine meant to be used for gaming but my project is not a game and there is an important collection of use cases where objects in a scene and in the UI must be kept secure from arbitrary script access.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince scripts are giving access to the engine, I am guessing there is a way to gain access to most Urho3D objects (such as scene nodes and UI elements) through scripting.  So here are my questions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIs this true?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow does a script gain access to objects?  Is there a hash table of object names?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf so… where in the code does this table exist? (I have found several tables so far but all are of object attributes, types, categories, factories, etc… I have not not found the table for the objects themselves)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy guess is that my project will need to provide or modify the underlying object management layer so that any script that should not have access to an object will get a null pointer/object if the object requires a higher security level than the script (or the application detects that security has been compromised).  My last two questions are: does this sound feasible?  If not, can scripting be disabled entirely?

Nope.  Not in Ohio.  Software like this doesn’t exist yet.  I hope to get it out there before someone else thinks of it.  It does use a type of client-server model.  However, I would think that controlling access like I am suggesting wouldn’t be that difficult if one thought of the need (specific set of use cases) ahead of time. From what your suggesting though, it sounds like that wasn’t the intention of any 3D engine currently in existence.  If the source code doesn’t provide a “neat”, centrallly located way of resolving what object is being looked up by a script, I can just not use the internal script engine and build my own later (or have it built by someone more capable).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for my approach: Since I currently don’t have any formal training in security techniques there may be a few things I am not considering regarding security.  However, I designed my object manager like this: basically I have a lookup table of objects with both a saved key and an authorization level.  If a lookup is attempted using a script that originates from a user without the proper access level, or that script was inserted without the proper access key, trying to do a lookup for a “secured” object will fail and return a null object.  The point of this “security” in the gui/3d interface is not to keep “information” private.  It is to keep end users of a specific role from being able to perform specific tasks in certain use cases and/or contexts\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I said in my introductory post, I am prototyping.  My current task is to get the prototype out there and show it could work.

Let me give you some specifics on what my software would do with scripting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch of what happens in a scene is supposed to be script-able.  In fact, that will usually be the basis for much of the animation and action that occurs as a scene progresses.  However, let’s say the script supplied with a mod or add-on wants to impose a tutorial mode where at a particular point in the scene, other functionality is temporarily disabled.  The DLC based add-on has a higher “level of access” than the user and disables the UI and other access until the user accomplishes a specific task.  The user then tries to circumvent this “lockout” by another custom addon/script.  The objective is to not allow the user (with a lower level of access) to accomplish this circumvention.  However, now let’s say that the user gets stuck on something later and needs help from a person with technical support access.  This support person’s level of access would be higher than the script.  So they would be able to disable the lockout or at least access an appropriate object in the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the core of the engine are two low level (not quite base) classes that represent this lock and key mechanism: a KeyedObject and an AccessAgent.  3D and UI objects inherit from KeyedObject while users and scripts inherit from AccessAgent.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":9,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2018-10-04T17:41:53.146Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":8,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":28,"readers_count":27,"score":10.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":4574,"topic_slug":"noob-scripting-and-object-access-questions","display_username":"Matthew","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":2,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"reply_to_user":{"username":"Eugene","name":"Eugene Kozlov","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/eugene/{size}/902_2.png"},"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1055,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":26140,"name":"Eugene Kozlov","username":"Eugene","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/eugene/{size}/902_2.png","created_at":"2018-10-04T14:53:10.460Z","cooked":"\u003caside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"primem0ver\" data-post=\"9\" data-topic=\"4574\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/p/76d3ee/40.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003e primem0ver:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom what you are saying, I am guessing I should disable the “native” or embedded scripting altogether\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suggest you to disable all parts of the scripting that you consider malicious.\u003cbr\u003e\nAs I understand, you want multiple levels of access.
