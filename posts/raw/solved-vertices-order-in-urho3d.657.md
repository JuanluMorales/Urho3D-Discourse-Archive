Hello ,
I am stuck with the order of the vertices in Urho3D. What I am doing at the moment is exporting obj from maya and converting to mdl using the AssetImporter tool provided with Urho3D . Which gives me a good model that I can import in Urho, then I query the vertices buffer and indices buffer . I can see that the order of the indices is with x and z swapped from the original obj which is easy to fix but I am getting completely random order in the vertices buffer. I will try and post a few test cases later tonight. 

Thanks,

Alex
