Hello guys!

I have a problem with water reflection on mobile platform. If the camera goes to a certain height from the water plane, the reflection disappears. On pc there is no problem like this. I guess its some sort of limitation, but cannot find how to increase the limit. I hope someone can help me a bit. I'm using Urho 1.7.

Thanks, I searched for the topic, but I've missed that post. And also thanks for the documentation part!
