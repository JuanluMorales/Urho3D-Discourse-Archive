Hey guys, I've decided to use Urho3D combining with an old game, this way I can use urho features and keep using the engine of my game. My goal its update game engine of my old game slowly.

Today I did Urho renderer works together to my render successful, BUT, sometimes when I move the free camera, I got some weird problem on Urho renderer. Happens on determinate position of camera, this way, it isnt every time. 

I dont know so much how I can describe the problem, but u guys can see on the video (in the determinate time render just one mesh):

Do you use Visual Studio 2017, 64 bits debug build?

Was 32 bits and release mode. Btw I've fixed the problem for now taking out the plane of floor (as I said, for now all is working good).

The topic has no more utility for a while, thanks anyway.
