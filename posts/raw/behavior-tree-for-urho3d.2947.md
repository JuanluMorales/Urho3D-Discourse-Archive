Hello Everybody!
I've created behavior tree system for Urho3D. This implementation is based on event-drivenBT from  <a href="https://youtu.be/n4aREFb3SsU">this video</a> (~36 min)

You can get source code from  <a href ="https://github.com/lezak/Urho3DBehaviorTree"> here</a>.
Also check out <a href="https://github.com/lezak/Urho3DBehaviorTreeDemo"> demo project</a> for some basic intructions (especially source files for Example1 - right now I don't have time to write more detailed instruction). 
If You are Windows(64 bits) user, You can get binary form of demo <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0msHYrZwQHYT056R3d2UnVLc1U/view?usp=sharing"> from here </a>.
I hope You'll find this useful.

Thanks, will try it out. The best implementation that I have seen so far is Behaviour Designer in Unity: http://www.opsive.com/assets/BehaviorDesigner/
