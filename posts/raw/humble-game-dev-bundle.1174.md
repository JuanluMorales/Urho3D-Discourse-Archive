So over at [url=http://www.humblebundle.com]Humble Bundle[/url], they've got a Game Dev bundle going on. The "DLC" assets (originally for RPG Maker) are all licensed for use in engines that are [b]not[/b] RPG Maker (so, e.g. Urho3D).

Additionally, Spriter Pro looks like it could be handy for things, and has a Linux build as well. Sprite Lamp could be handy for doing normal maps without doing a high poly model as well.

Just thought I'd throw it up here for anyone who hadn't seen it yet :slight_smile:
