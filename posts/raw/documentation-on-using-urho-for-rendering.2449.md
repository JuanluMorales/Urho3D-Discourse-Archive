Hello.
I see this started back in the days as a rendering engine (like Ogre/Horde) but turned into a fully featured game engine. I'm wondering if the old goals were dropped or something because I'd like to use this more like a rendering engine with bells and whistles but can't find anything on manually rendering like creating and drawing VBOs and such.
Thanks.

From [urho3d.github.io/documentation/ ... ering.html](https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_rendering.html) ..the Graphics class implements low-level functionality.

Just to throw out a bunch of examples of Urho using VertexBuffer...
