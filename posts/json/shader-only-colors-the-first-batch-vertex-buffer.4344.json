This shader is based on \u003ccode\u003eLitSolid.hlsl\u003c/code\u003e. For the purpose to determine a subobject via raycast I created my model (used as StaticModel) with multiple Vertex Buffers (one per object, I used the UrhoExporter Addon for blender to achieve this). (A single node per subobject was not an option due to the resulting performance).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I use the model with multiple Vertex Buffers, my shader’s effects and colors and the clipping as well, only apply to the first submodel/Vertex Buffer. As I initially searched the problem in my own code I tried the same with all default settings and shaders, with a simple \u003ccode\u003emodel.Material = Material.FromColor(Color.Yellow);\u003c/code\u003e and discovered the same issue. Only the first subobject gets properly rendered. All other objectes are just white pixels (only the silhouette without shadows or anything)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the screenshot (1) you can see the yellow buildung is the subobject in the first vertex buffer, all others are pure white. The red dot-dashed line indicates where the objects should be cutted by the shader (this line was added manually - it is not part of the shader). This screenshot was done with the default LitSolid shader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following screenshot (2) uses my own shader, there you can see, the clipping and coloring works, but also only for the first object\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last screenshot (3) shows how it should look like. But this is currently only possible, if I use one vertex buffer for all buildungs together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdck-file-uploads-global.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/2X/b/b212b6387ed9b1f75ebf50229843c09c8f6b21c5.jpg\" alt=\"urho-shader-first-vertex-buffer-combined\" width=\"318\" height=\"500\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment I am quit lost of ideas how to solve or debug this Problem. I think it is somehow necessary to tell the shader to use all/further vertex buffers as well or to combine them before they get passed to the GPU, but I have no real idea how to do this. I am also quite new to 3D development and shaders, which does not make it easier \u003cimg src=\"/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m using UrhoSharp v1.8.93 in an C# UWP application.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2018-06-21T13:22:28.604Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":4,"reads":37,"readers_count":36,"score":32.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":4344,"topic_slug":"shader-only-colors-the-first-batch-vertex-buffer","display_username":"Ahorn42","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1011,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":25076,"name":"SirNate0","username":"SirNate0","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/9f8e36/{size}.png","created_at":"2018-06-22T04:09:11.691Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eI don’t know how properties work in C#, but StaticModel::SetMaterial is supposed to set the material on all geometries.
