Hi att,
wow! your a fellow GP3D'er  :laughing: 
Why did you switch? poor blender support (fbx)?
I'm still testing Urho3D out and getting to now it.. so still not 100% sure.
Compared to GP3D, it's very very complicated.. a lot more abstraction, pointers, templates etc... but saying that it's more open with more features :unamused: 

Anyway, I'll try out your game when I get home  :smiley:

Hi, 
I'm glad to see you here, :smiley: 
GP3D is a great engine, I like it. But It update too slow. Urho3D is component-base engine, more importantly, it has a very very great scene editor. I think you would like it too.

That is what is also selling me on this one. It actually has a friggin' scene editor. No plugin silliness.
