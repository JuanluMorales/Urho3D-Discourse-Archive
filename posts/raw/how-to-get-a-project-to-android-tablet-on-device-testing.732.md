Hello everyone,

I tried to search for 'android' and got this:

[quote]The following words in your search query were ignored because they are too common words: android[/quote]

[color=#33339F]=========================================================================================

Firstly; a quick little about me:

I'm new here and also practically brand new to Android development.  I don't know java although I'm pretty awesome at JavaScript.  I plan to either program in C++11/C++14 or script using lua or maybe luajit and was hopeing that Urho3D would be the right place for me  :smiley: 

I have used 'ant' to get an android c++11/ndk to my Android Tablet for testing with another engine that I like but need more features than it currently can provide.  So I found Urho3D and decided to give this a try after seeing videos about it on youtube.

[ol][li]My "[u][b]Target Platforms[/b][/u]" are: Android Tablets, Android Smart Phones, Android TV, Amazon Marketplace, BlackBerry 2015 Devices, Linux ( Ubuntu and possibly other flavors ).[/li]
[li]My "[u][b]Future Possible Target Platforms[/b][/u]" are: Rasberry Pi, FireFox OS, Tizen?, MacOSX, iOS, Windows 7 and 8.1[/li]
[li]My "[u][b]I'd like to get to these console platforms[/b][/u]" are: OUYA, Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo Wii, Nintendo Wii-U, Playstation 2 & 3 & 4, PSVita, PSP, mayyybe original xbox and 360?[/li]
[li]Currently I do not intend to develop for xbox one nor windows rt nor windows phone but may consider after all of the above are good ( i have to prioritize of course )[/li][/ol]

=========================================================================================

And now for my question:

My development platform is: * Linux Mint 17.1 64-bit * Android SDK's API 16~Latest_API * ANT * make/cmake * gcc * gedit * and a usb cable *

If someone could point me in the right direction or a url to the documentation about using my Android Device to test on or even a general getting started article or two, i would be most grateful.

Many thanks in advance for any help,

Rich
