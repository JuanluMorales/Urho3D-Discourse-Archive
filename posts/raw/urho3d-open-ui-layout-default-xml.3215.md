When you invoke the dafaultstyle.xml it oopens to the window that looks like a whole story board. I am wondering since I have looked at the angelscripts that are included with the engine. 
Is it built into a script in the scripts directory or is that exact window built in source.

Could someone please point me the the source.cpp files if necessary?

The window on the top what is the source necessary to build this window? Is it just a few source.cpp files that run under something.as. In my UI Layout open Box. defaltstyles.xml open it up and I don't have a clue off hand what way to reference this in my project yet.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
