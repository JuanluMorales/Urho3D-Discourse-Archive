I’ve compiled Urho3d 1.7 and everything works fine except when I try to use a 3d model I converted from AssetImporter. The model itself seems to load fine but I can never get the diffuse texture to show. I’ve read the documentation and scoured the forums heres a screenshot. \u003cimg src=\"//cdck-file-uploads-global.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/1X/ac8f85a4646d409ce3e68165c89161b01c191540.jpg\" alt=\"screen1\" width=\"690\" height=\"291\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso with the animation I ran into 2 problems. One the animation appears to be playing way to fast. Two I believe the AssetImporter removed key frames and ruined the animation. I viewed this topic and commented out the part of code in AssetImporter and when I convert the model I don’t get any errors however the animation is still ruined only parts of the model animate correctly. \u003ca href=\"https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/cant-get-animations-in-this-model-to-work/2709\"\u003eTopic on differing channel keyrames\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI use 3ds
