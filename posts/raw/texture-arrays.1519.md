Hey Sinoid,

Good to see texture arrays supported! I think among like 3 of us we've kind of made support for them, but it's cool to see backwards-compatibility with DX9/GL2 which I wasn't too fussed about, especially when reading about any kind of UV tweakings causes really terrible performance on a lot of ES2.x hardware...

I noticed your Urho3D repo is gone from github, is that permanent or are you refreshing it? My TextureArray code was a bit old so I thought I'd just use yours with PBR. (I've got a small bit of time to play around with some rendering experiments with the GearVR in-mind but still hit 60fps using ES 3.1+AEP, using SSBumps and lightmap RNM's from Turtle renderer baking).

Thanks Sinoid
