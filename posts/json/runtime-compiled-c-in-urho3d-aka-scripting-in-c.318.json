I took the idea of using C++ as a scripting language from <a href=\"http://molecularmusings.wordpress.com/2013/08/27/using-runtime-compiled-c-code-as-a-scripting-language/\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://molecularmusings.wordpress.com/2013/08/27/using-runtime-compiled-c-code-as-a-scripting-language/</a> and <a href=\"http://runtimecompiledcplusplus.blogspot.com\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://runtimecompiledcplusplus.blogspot.com</a>. This is technically called \u201cRuntime-compiled C++\u201d, which I\u2019ll call RCCpp from now on.</p>\n<p>Obviously, C++ is not a real scripting language, nor it tends to be. The main goal is to shrink iterations\u2019 time while having a quick preview of what you\u2019re trying to accomplish while using a well-known language such as C++. You have the power of C++ with trusted IDEs, autocompletion, debugger and everything you\u2019d need to work already, so you don\u2019t need either to learn other language nor look for new tools to work with Lua or AngelScript. Of course, you can still shoot yourself in the foot, and have to be very careful about memory leaks, as the idea is to have Urho3DPlayer always running while it loads dynamically a recent compiled version of what you\u2019re trying to do. Ok, enough chit-chat. This is what it looks like:</p>\n<p>Enable HD to be able to read the code<br>\n</p><div class=\"lazyYT\" data-youtube-id=\"uRf0LXjZWO0\" data-youtube-title=\"Runtime-compiled C++ working in Urho3D\" data-width=\"480\" data-height=\"270\" data-parameters=\"feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque\"></div>\n<p>To put it simple those are the steps that Urho3D\u2019s RCCpp follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If a .cpp is passed as an argument (instead of a .lua or .as), a Makefile is generated on the fly (only GCC/MinGW is supported for now) with all the .cpp\u2019s within that same folder and compiles everything into a shared library. So let\u2019s say we run \u201cUrho3DPlayer RCCpp/Game.cpp\u201d. This will try to compile Game.cpp and all the cpp\u2019s within RCCpp into a shared library called Game.dll (or Game.so if we\u2019re on a Unix system). If instead we pass an already compiled library (.dll or .so), step 2 applies inmediately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the compilation succeeds, it will load at runtime the shared library and will execute its \u201cStart\u201d method, the same way it\u2019s done with Lua or AngelScript.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Every time there\u2019s a change in any .cpp being watched (within RCCpp folder, in this case), it will compile again and if it was successful, it will call the \u201cStop\u201d method of Game, destroy the old Game object, unload the old library, load the new one and call its \u201cStart\u201d method. This has been done this way to avoid freezing the update loop so that the game plays as smoothly as possible. Please note that a total different object is created, so if you would like to have exactly the same state as before, you\u2019ll have to serialize and unserialize it by yourself.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, right now everything is compiled into a single library. This has pros and cons, but I ended up doing it like that because if I wanted to have a different library for each class (which is desirable in terms of extensibility and speed, so that I don\u2019t have to unload and load all the classes at the same time, just the ones that need to be replaced) I\u2019d have to use a fixed interface (usually Update and Render methods) and have somehow a list of dependencies among classes so that if I change one class, all of its dependant classes are also compiled or at least reloaded. This was quite painful at the end, so having everything in a single library eases things up and avoids some other problems.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve tried to follow the rules that I\u2019ve read in the documentation so that RCCpp is only used if a define is passed via CMake (URHO3D_RCCPP) and so on. I use the FileWatcher to know when a file has changed and needs to be recompiled. I also send useful events when a library/class is going to be unloaded or loaded, when the compilation has started or finished and so. It\u2019s been tested it on Mac and Windows (with MinGW, no Visual Studio support yet) and it should work on Linux too. The only thing you need to make it work is adding your toolchain binary folder in your path so that \u201cmake\u201d and \u201cg++\u201d can be called and define an environment variable called URHO3D_HOME pointing to your Urho3D\u2019s main folder so that the include and library paths can be found in order to compile. You could also create a \u201cPreMakefile\u201d that will be included at the very beginning of the Makefile to pass to the compiler/linker your own flags. Take a look into the content of the Makefile generated to find the name of the variables to set.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts about this. Do you think is useful, do you think is a waste of time, what would you improve, do you have any suggestions? I\u2019ve easily ported all the examples so that the same file and the same code works for the C++ samples as well as for RCCpp using a couple macros. The code is not the cleanest nor the most commented thing right now, but if people are interested, we could clean things up together and polish the bugs that may arise: <a href=\"https://github.com/pamarcos/Urho3D/tree/RCCpp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">github.com/pamarcos/Urho3D/tree/RCCpp</a></p>", "post_number": 1, "post_type": 1, "updated_at": "2019-05-12T19:07:21.498Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 553, "reads": 75, "readers_count": 74, "score": 2876.0, "yours": false, "topic_id": 318, "topic_slug": "runtime-compiled-c-in-urho3d-aka-scripting-in-c", "display_username": "", "primary_group_name": null, "flair_name": null, "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": null, "flair_color": null, "version": 2, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_wiki": false, "link_counts": [{"url": "https://github.com/pamarcos/Urho3D/tree/RCCpp", "internal": false, "reflection": false, "title": "GitHub - pamarcos/Urho3D at RCCpp", "clicks": 84}, {"url": "http://molecularmusings.wordpress.com/2013/08/27/using-runtime-compiled-c-code-as-a-scripting-language/", "internal": false, "reflection": false, "clicks": 48}, {"url": "http://runtimecompiledcplusplus.blogspot.com", "internal": false, "reflection": false, "title": "Runtime-Compiled C++", "clicks": 29}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRf0LXjZWO0", "internal": false, "reflection": false, "title": "YouTube", "clicks": 10}, {"url": "https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/c-as-the-scripting-language/2880/12", "internal": true, "reflection": true, "title": "C++ as the scripting language", "clicks": 1}, {"url": "https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/c-script-and-visualscript/5611/4", "internal": true, "reflection": true, "title": "C++ script and VisualScript", "clicks": 1}, {"url": "https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/how-to-runtime-compile-c-on-mac-os/3754/2", "internal": true, "reflection": true, "title": "How to runtime compile c++ on Mac OS", "clicks": 0}, {"url": "https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/imgui-integration/6786/3", "internal": true, "reflection": true, "title": "ImGui integration?", "clicks": 0}], "read": true, "user_title": null, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 1}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 98, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false}, {"id": 1706, "name": "", "username": "thebluefish", "avatar_template": "https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/t/f04885/{size}.png", "created_at": "2014-06-25T01:53:31.000Z", "cooked": "<p>Interesting idea.

Anyway, a game bottleneck is usually its core (which in this case is already in C++, so no problem here) rather than the game logic.

If you take a look at RCCppWin you\u2019ll notice that I have to do some kind of hack in order to hot-swap the library. The compilation fails to create the library because it\u2019s still being used (which doesn\u2019t happen un Mac). Funny thing is that whereas you cannot change the content of the library itself, you can change the name. So what it\u2019s done is: change the old library name (let\u2019s say from Game.dll to Game.dll.old), compile the new code to Game.dll, unload the old library and load the new one. Once this is done, the .old version is removed. However, this doesn\u2019t seem to be your issue, as if this was the case, the compilation would fail during the linking process.</p>\n<p>Thanks everyone for checking this out.

I\u2019ve had exactly the same problem that you described. It\u2019s been a while until I\u2019ve found the issue. It seems dlclose is not closing properly the library and so, every time dlopen is called it returns exactly the same handler (which is the handler to the very first version of the library compiled) so nothing really changes in the game apart from destroying the main object and creating it again. If you take a look at the documentation at <a href=\"http://linux.die.net/man/3/dlclose\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">linux.die.net/man/3/dlclose</a> it says:</p>\n<aside class=\"quote\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the same library is loaded again with dlopen(), the same file handle is returned. The dl library maintains reference counts for library handles, so a dynamic library is not deallocated until dlclose() has been called on it as many times as dlopen() has succeeded on it. The _init() routine, if present, is only called once. But a subsequent call with RTLD_NOW may force symbol resolution for a library earlier loaded with RTLD_LAZY.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>As far as I understand, it seems that the reference count system is not working as it should or something I can\u2019t understand is happening. In Mac is working well, though (which makes sense, because there\u2019s only one dlopen-dlclose pair). I\u2019m not very proud of what I\u2019ve done to make it work, but it\u2019s working and I think that\u2019s enough for a day. I hope it works for you as well.<br>\nGive it a try: <a href=\"https://github.com/pamarcos/Urho3D/commit/2ae5db35b0da3eb947b066185a99219ec3c09a5c\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">github.com/pamarcos/Urho3D/comm \u2026 9ec3c09a5c</a></p>", "post_number": 11, "post_type": 1, "updated_at": "2017-01-02T00:59:37.340Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 1, "incoming_link_count": 2, "reads": 36, "readers_count": 35, "score": 17.2, "yours": false, "topic_id": 318, "topic_slug": "runtime-compiled-c-in-urho3d-aka-scripting-in-c", "display_username": "", "primary_group_name": null, "flair_name": null, "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": null, "flair_color": null, "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_wiki": false, "link_counts": [{"url": "https://github.com/pamarcos/Urho3D/commit/2ae5db35b0da3eb947b066185a99219ec3c09a5c", "internal": false, "reflection": false, "title": "Hack to make RCCpp work on Linux. \u00b7 pamarcos/Urho3D@2ae5db3 \u00b7 GitHub", "clicks": 3}, {"url": "http://linux.die.net/man/3/dlclose", "internal": false, "reflection": false, "title": "dlclose(3) -

So, you have to take care of everything else by yourself. If you added something to the UI\u2019s root, you\u2019ll have to remove it either in the Stop method or in the destructor of your RCCppMainObject so that when the new one is created, you don\u2019t have duplicates.

Adding an option to avoid reloading everything by RCCpp and leaving you to do it whenever you want should not be difficult. Having said that, there are 6 different events that RCCpp is already firing to give you the possibility to clean things up your way. Those are: E_RCCPP_COMPILATION_STARTED, E_RCCPP_COMPILATION_FINISHED, E_RCCPP_LIBRARY_PRELOADED, E_RCCPP_LIBRARY_POSTLOADED, E_RCCPP_CLASS_PRELOADED, E_RCCPP_CLASS_POSTLOADED. So, you can still set up a listener to any of those methods in order to do something before the library is really reloaded. What you can\u2019t do right now is stopping the process to reload it whenever you want. I\u2019ll give it some thoughts of how that could be done in an easy way.</p>\n<p>[quote=\u201cDougBinks\u201d]Doug here Runtime-Compiled C++.</p>\n<p>In our RCC++ implementation we only compile changed files, so load these as new modules with a temp name to avoid name clashing and so we can keep the old modules open (as they may contain code still being used).

I was mind-blown the first time I visited your webpage. It\u2019s quite impressive to see C++ compiled and loaded at runtime. I mean, when you think about it you realize it\u2019s technically feasible to do it, but still impressive. I tested the samples and so, but unfortunately I haven\u2019t had much spare time to look at the code to know how everything works.<br>\nFor the very first version of RCCpp in Urho3D, instead of using a Makefile system that would compile everything into a single library, I thought of having a different shared library for every class. That in terms of modularity is desirable, but the \u201cone-single library\u201d approach won in terms of simplicity. The overhead of loading the whole library for a single class is still there, but I avoided the following issues:</p>\n<p>[ul]</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Compiling everything the very first time. Makefile does the work compiling only the necessary files, because otherwise I\u2019d have to implement some kind of file date checking to see if the libraries are up-to-date and compile only the files needed.</li>\n<li>How do you solve dependencies among libraries? You have to specify one way or another what other libraries you depend on so that when some of that libraries is compiled, you create a new oject of that kind. I thought of having a Class.rcpp file with that kind of information, or embedding some commented code into any class\u2019 cpp file (yeah, that would be specially ugly) specifying that and parsing it from RCCpp. Another option would be to parse every file and recompile everything including Class.h. I didn\u2019t like any of the solutions, though.</li>\n<li>By compiling everything, destroying everything and creating it again I ensure that every object is an up-to-date version.<br>\n[/ul]</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I get that by creating temporary names for the libraries you can still use the old ones. But why would you want to use an older version of the library/module? Shouldn\u2019t every class reload the new version of the class? Or you simply let the coder choose whether he wants to reload a new version or not? Another question I have is how do you handle exceptions in Mac and Linux where you don\u2019t really have SEH.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance.

Our objective with the RCC++ project was to change people\u2019s minds about how C and C++ can be used, and it seems we\u2019re getting there. I\u2019ve added Urho3d to a <a href=\"https://github.com/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/wiki/Alternatives\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">list I keep of projects using RCC++</a>.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll find answers to some questions on <a href=\"https://github.com/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/wiki\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">our wiki</a>, and there\u2019s a chapter on RCC++ in the book Game AI Pro if you can get hold of it.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Our RCC++ implementation is designed to be used to re-compile code as fast as possible. We avoid needing makefiles etc. as the developer uses their existing infrastructure to compile the code in any way they like, and RCC++ simply handles re-compilation at runtime when a source file is changed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We solve dependencies by embedding the information in the compiled code. See the wiki on <a href=\"https://github.com/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/wiki/Specifying-include-directories\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">includes</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/wiki/Using-libraries-from-runtime-modifiable-classes\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">libraries</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/wiki/Runtime-modifiable-header-files\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">modifiable headers</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/wiki/Runtime-source-dependencies\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">source dependencies</a>. Recently people have <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/runtimecompiledcplusplus/2_I-kewQgvc\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">started to use RCC++ for scripting</a>, where they want to compile new code and I\u2019m looking into ways to make this easier. Personally I prefer using my normal tool chain and just using RCC++ for changes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We still perform a full data reload (in memory), but keep the compiled and linked code as small as possible. Linkage is often a rate-determining step so this helps considerably. Recently I\u2019m finding the full-reload can be more lengthy that it needs to be so I\u2019m considering adding support for only reloading data for modified files.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We need to keep old libraries around as our implementation compiles changes and dependencies into a single dll per <a href=\"https://github.com/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/wiki/Using-ProjectIds-and-Projects\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\u2018project\u2019</a> (most users only need one project). So a library may contain code from a.cpp and b.cpp, then when b.cpp changes we get a new library only containing the code from b.cpp, so need to keep the old library for the code from a.cpp. In many cases, the original code is compiled into the executable, so obviously that needs to be kept around.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For error protection outside of windows we use signals. Take a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/wiki/Error-protection\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the wiki page on error protection</a> and code for <a href=\"https://github.com/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/blob/master/Aurora/RuntimeObjectSystem/RuntimeProtector.h\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">RuntimeProtector.h</a> and implementation in <a href=\"https://github.com/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus/blob/master/Aurora/RuntimeObjectSystem/RuntimeObjectSystem_PlatformPosix.cpp\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">RuntimeObjectSystem_PlatformPosix.cpp</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember that since our RCC++ implementation uses a liberal license, you can borrow as much or as little of the code as you need for Urho3d.

Then, inside you have to create a class that inherits from RCCppMainObject and reimplement their Start and Stop methods, which will be the ones that Urho3D will call at the beginning and end, respectively. Then, you just have to call \u201cUrho3dPlayer.exe MyMainClass.cpp\u201d (as in any AngelScript or Lua script, besides any other parameters you may need). For any other component that you want to use, just remember that you have to inherit from RCCppObject and that you have to place the cpp file within the same folder as the RCCppMainObject\u2019s file. You can also reimplement the Start/Stop methods of those additional components, but it\u2019s not mandatory. To use the components from RCCppMainObject you just have to include its header as you would do normally and that\u2019s all. RCC++ should be smart enough and create the proper Makefile to include every cpp within the folder of the project.</p>\n<p>Having said that, you may need some work to make Visual Studio compile the Makefile succesfully. Take a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/pamarcos/Urho3D/blob/RCCpp/Source/Engine/RCCpp/RCCppGppCompiler.cpp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">github.com/pamarcos/Urho3D/blob \u2026 mpiler.cpp</a>. You\u2019ll have to use nmake instead of make. I\u2019m not sure the original Makefile created will be ok for MSVC, but you can create a RCCppMsvcCompiler.cpp that does something similar but for Visual Studio.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">#ifdef __MINGW32__\n    SYSTEM_INFO sysinfo;\n    GetSystemInfo(&amp;sysinfo);\n    int cores_ = sysinfo.dwNumberOfProcessors;\n    makeCommand_ = \"mingw32-make -j\" + String(cores_);\n#else\n    int cores_ = sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN);\n    makeCommand_ = \"make -j\" + String(cores_);\n#endif</code></pre>\n<p>I hope it helps.

I\u2019m not very familiar with the installation process of apps for iOS, but my guess is that you\u2019d like to have the game running on the device and be able to change the code in your machine, compile it and upload the new library to the device so that it changes the behavior of the game instance running at the moment. As far as you\u2019re able to load a library at runtime, you should be able to load another library and start using it. What I\u2019m concerned is that you should either have a button to know when to reload the library, or implement by your own something like Urho3D has to detect file changes (take also a look at <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/simplefilewatcher/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">code.google.com/p/simplefilewatcher/</a>), but I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll be able to do that in iOS. The other hard thing would be to upload a file to some place within iOS where your app would have access to read, and I\u2019m not sure the OS would allow you to do that (without reinstalling the whole application) either. On the other hand, I do think this could be done in Android, as you have access to push files to different locations and in Java as far as I know you can unload and load native libraries again.</p>\n<p>If anyone\u2019s got expertice about this, please post your thoughts.</p>", "post_number": 26, "post_type": 1, "updated_at": "2017-01-02T01:00:53.687Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 1, "incoming_link_count": 0, "reads": 22, "readers_count": 21, "score": 4.4, "yours": false, "topic_id": 318, "topic_slug": "runtime-compiled-c-in-urho3d-aka-scripting-in-c", "display_username": "", "primary_group_name": null, "flair_name": null, "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": null, "flair_color": null, "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_wiki": false, "link_counts": [{"url": "https://code.google.com/p/simplefilewatcher/", "internal": false, "reflection": false, "title": "Google Code Archive - Long-term storage for Google Code Project Hosting.", "clicks": 0}], "read": true, "user_title": null, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 98, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false}, {"id": 2738, "name": "", "username": "sabotage3d", "avatar_template": "/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/sabotage3d/{size}/87_2.png", "created_at": "2014-10-26T20:42:23.000Z", "cooked": "<p>I think this could work with the simulator and it would be more useful anyway.

I am thinking about making this a lightweight runtime-compiled C++ library and do the integration with Urho3D as I have done. In there, I could implement some state saving to restore the state between different compilations. I have been taking a look at <a href=\"http://uscilab.github.io/cereal/index.html\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://uscilab.github.io/cereal/index.html</a> and it looks quite promising.<br>\nHowever, it\u2019s up to the developer to know whether it should save and load something or not. Also, depending on what you\u2019re trying to do and how, the class may have weird behavior or even crash when reloading it. One has to take into account that not everything is destructed and constructed again, but only the classes you are working with. This means that for instance if you took the UI root node and draw something within it, if you don\u2019t remove it in your Stop (or destructor), when Start (or constructor) draws again over the UI root, you will have the same thing drawn twice.</p>", "post_number": 40, "post_type": 1, "updated_at": "2017-01-02T01:06:45.602Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 1, "incoming_link_count": 0, "reads": 25, "readers_count": 24, "score": 5.0, "yours": false, "topic_id": 318, "topic_slug": "runtime-compiled-c-in-urho3d-aka-scripting-in-c", "display_username": "", "primary_group_name": null, "flair_name": null, "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": null, "flair_color": null, "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_wiki": false, "link_counts": [{"url": "http://uscilab.github.io/cereal/index.html", "internal": false, "reflection": false, "title": "cereal Docs - Main", "clicks": 1}, {"url": "http://codepad.org/VWjsczg2", "internal": false, "reflection": false, "title": "Plain Text code - 202 lines - codepad", "clicks": 0}], "read": true, "user_title": null, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 98, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false}, {"id": 7440, "name": "", "username": "sabotage3d", "avatar_template": "/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/sabotage3d/{size}/87_2.png", "created_at": "2015-08-29T10:51:55.000Z", "cooked": "<p>Thanks a lot.
