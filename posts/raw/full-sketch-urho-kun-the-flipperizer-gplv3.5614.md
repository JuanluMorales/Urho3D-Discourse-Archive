as godot have Godotchan, Unity... UnityChan, why Urho3D doesn't can have one too? maybe Urho-Kun?

(normally chan is for girl, kun is for boys, anyone can correct me if i wrong about this?)

i'm using MB-Lab and some internet photos as base to make face and clothes, after i'll try to make 3D of this body again but already making the face and cloth/body
it will be a soldier

project showing 3 images and random colors (based on urho fish photo and more other things, just some colors will be used, i'll try to mix 2 colors and blablabla) that can be used on him (it will use unicolor, to make able to use celshading-two-colors too):

I made [Ahab](https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/ahab/1895) a while ago because I felt the same humanoid mascot void. But he could use some work.

@Modanung, this song played on my head when i did see Ahab:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27mB8verLK8

Modanung | 2019-09-22 21:56:47 UTC | #5

Yea, I think that fits his image. :wink:

[![Ahab](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Moby_Dick_final_chase.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Ahab)

Btw, I did not intend to copy the character, but rather draw inspiration from it. Somehow I thought people here might identify with him. In part because [Ahab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Ahab) is famously contrasted by a "fish" (aquatic vertebrate) that he tries to master.

the idea is maintain the modern detail but mixing a little bit with SCI-FI:

Ah, "Flipperizer" makes more sense than "Falconizer". Could I give advice?
Since the theme is "fish", could you add gills?
But instead on the neck, as there are several characters like that, how about the cheek, just like Naruto?

first base to modellers released, i'm planning to model him cause i need to learn how, but not now, u guys can model if u guys wanna do this (it's not finished/colored yet, missing top view and top and front gun weapon view):

![firstbase|690x388](upload://fz2rKNhPtaHSYQIDKbQZv5dSkAG.png) 

@marialnmgrace falconizer was just cause i was excited * thank you *, too much creativity lol... and sure! :slight_smile: 

https://media.giphy.com/media/IcGkqdUmYLFGE/giphy.gif

@weitjong tell me more about the fake eye (where)? i can do this on the gun weapon (front view)

@Modanung this image is too much s*xy for my eyes, i'm disabling "image view" on my browser for now

-------------------------

Modanung | 2019-09-23 14:15:48 UTC | #14

Your work so far together with the conversation reminded me of Aquaman. His muscle structure seems quite similar to that of the model in your first post... and he's aquatic.

-------------------------

brojonisbro | 2019-09-23 15:51:12 UTC | #15

@Modanung i was doing the details, cloths,etc to make a new model based on the model generated with MB-Lab, it is a little intentional, but now it's a ANIME! lol! xD

the idea is from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1CTfis1TEg

Looking at your sketch, you draw good. Why to use a base?

-------------------------

brojonisbro | 2019-09-23 18:03:43 UTC | #17

nah, i'm not that good and to do a perfect T-POSE

releasing the sketch fast as possible just cause for no one of other engines or whatever frameworks or groups won't steal/copy/clone the idea (and i'm too lazy for now xD)

anyone can help me to model? maybe a new demo for the engine too (thinking about 3rd person shooter)?

colors for painters (always trying to combine colors using color theory, change any if is needed):
-hair: gray + orange + blue
-eyes: blue
-skin: whatever
-gloves,bags and boots: dark gray
-armor plates: silver
-soldier cloth: white/light brown
-armor: light yellow
-gun: whatever, no talking about some details, default is black/gray

below, the sketchs:

GoldenThumbs | 2019-09-24 09:00:48 UTC | #19

Dang, I want to take part in this now. Next time I post here I'll probably have some sketch for a concept. Be warned: It'll probably be a robot.

-------------------------

brojonisbro | 2019-09-24 10:10:23 UTC | #20

thanks for help! such a character for urho3d can help more peoples see the engine , I don't doubt someone who enjoys doing animation will do an urho-kun vs ??? and put it on youtube, then people will want to know where Urho-Kun is from, programmers will obviously(???) help with the engine.

of course that's my point of view, i think too far sometimes

and this will create a humanoid character from urho3d for demos, tests,etc , as unreal engine has that robot I'm already tired of seeing around xD

My 2p about MB-Lab licensing. Just to break some eggs.

https://blenderartists.org/t/mb-lab-release-for-blender-2-80/1138777/335

TL;DR; Imho: AGPL

(just replied to your other thread about Mixamo. Sorry, you inspired me.)

-------------------------

brojonisbro | 2019-09-24 16:19:47 UTC | #22

ok, so... next time i'll use Clip Studio Paint proprietary software

https://www.clipstudio.net/view/promotion/trial_tour/img/tour_12.jpg

-------------------------

kapsloki | 2019-09-25 12:21:12 UTC | #23

@brojonisbro You're not thinking of stopping are you? You got here, it would be nice to finish. As I understand it, @johnnycable said there is a problem with the character being released to or with MB-Lab, you are just drawing over to create a new 3D model, as you have shown with this proprietary software and that I researched for myself and saw that several people also drew even animations that way.

GPL or AGPL or MIT as Urho3D, I would like to see this done, and I bet I'm not alone.

I think this was a warning or criticism that fooled your mind, I think you are wrong, remove this license and continue. Of course, if you wish.

@edit: And your drawing is very different of the structure screenshot, gluteus for example, is bigger and more structured on your draw than the MB-Lab. Talking about other parts, it's a complete new model or at least 99,9%.

-------------------------

johnnycable | 2019-09-25 14:57:01 UTC | #24

Or you could use something like Miku Miku Dance addon for Blender:

-------------------------

marialnmgrace | 2019-09-25 20:32:24 UTC | #25

I don't wanna to disturb you boys, but I think he's gone and, MMD models and 3D models made with are based on Official Vocaloid Characters, they are proprietary too.

Anyone planning to continue his/her work?

-------------------------

kapsloki | 2019-09-25 21:43:57 UTC | #26

Looking at the facts, if you think about it, this model would be completely free, and it's funny that Manuel Bastioni himself went against his own MB-Lab license when he gave up and simply removed the plugin everywhere, luckily the community kept it up. Unfortunately I don't understand Blender yet, @GoldenThumbs said he would make a robot, what we have left is to wait, or try to make this character with this license or a completely new.

In my country we call this kind of attack a certain thing that I forgot the name.
