I wanted to try the terrain editor mentioned under "Tool integrations", but cannot find a ready to use one. It seems that I have to build it first from source. Is there any "ready to use one" somewhere? I mean I can just download it and run to play.
Thanks.

Hi,
JTippetts' Terrain Editor thread: [topic783.html](http://discourse.urho3d.io/t/terrain-editor/765/1)
I do not recall a binary distribution but maybe someone does.

Havent been following the terrain editor development lately, but it is worth mentioning that it was Windows only. I think Urho3d needs its own terrain tool integrated in the official editor.
