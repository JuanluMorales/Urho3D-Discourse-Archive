Edit: Had to set the hinge position properly on both parent/child and the high/low limits.

Hello, I'm trying to make a vehicle using the editor and these are the settings I have for the hinge constraint:

(settings got cutoff by forum, view the image in full size to see)

Even though the vehicle is on a slope, it's not moving.  Thanks for any help.

Hi.

You can run VehicleDemo, then press F7 to save the scene, then open it in Editor and look at constrain setup.
