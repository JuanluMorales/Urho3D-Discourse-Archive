I see that it is possible to set a relative position with the ‚ÄúMin Anchor‚Äù/‚ÄúMax Anchor‚Äù/‚ÄúPivot‚Äù attributes but for size attributes only absolute pixels seem to work. Of course I could calculate and adjust the size in code after reading the layout, but if in any way possible I would prefer to have it all in the XML layout file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(And another unrelated question, not sure if it warrants another topic:)\u003cbr\u003e\nUrho/SDL window creation seems to disable Windows aero designs, which is kind of ugly. Additionally, alt+tabbing causes a brief black screen flash, which is especially annoying if I have set the window to be a borderless fullscreen mode, this seems to be abnormal from the borderless-fullscreen-windowed mode that I know from any games.
