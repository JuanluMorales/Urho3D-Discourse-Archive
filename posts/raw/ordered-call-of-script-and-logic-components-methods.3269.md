Any ideas how to make calls ordered from first to last component?
It's pretty hard now to stack components with instable order of calls.

I use own events for specific order

This is as ugly as WinAPI, isn't it?
I can make some events and make "chain of subscription", of course.
But I'd like to have nice and universal solution.
