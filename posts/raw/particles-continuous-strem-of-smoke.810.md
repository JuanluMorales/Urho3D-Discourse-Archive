I tried to adapt the smoke effect from ninja demo, but I cant achieve a constant stream of smoke. I just get a couple of seconds of smoke, a short halt, and again smoke. What parameter should I tweak to make it a continue stream?

try this (in particle editor settings)

Active time = 0
Numbers of particles = 100
Emission rate = 13.3
