Hi all!

Just wanted to start a new [b]*thing*[/b] on this forum ^_^v! If you are presenting a tutorial as a screencast - please add [b][video][/b] in the topic's title. Anyways, without further ado - here's a screencast showing how to build a shared version of Urho3D v1.5 using Visual Studio Community 2015.

Could also use the more generic, and arguably much more widely used, term: video.

Agreed. Also, after watching my video - I noticed that sound is really lacking! = ) Will re-record with some vocal explanations and musical background...

In my opinion background music with informative videos can be annoying. If people want music with a step by step explanation they can put on some music themselves and choose the mix ratio of the two audio tracks.
It doesn't have to be entertaining; non-boringness and to-the-point works best, to my taste. I'll add my own sprinkles, thank you. :stuck_out_tongue:

Scratch the musical idea background. Re-doing with only vocal English explanation to what is happening in the video = )
