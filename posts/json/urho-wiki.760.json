Having said that, until this plan actually materializes or even after it has been materialized, I think there should be no issue with other wikis about Urho3D to exist in parallel.</p>", "post_number": 23, "post_type": 1, "updated_at": "2017-01-02T01:03:25.670Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 0, "reads": 10, "readers_count": 9, "score": 2.0, "yours": false, "topic_id": 760, "topic_slug": "urho-wiki", "display_username": "Yao Wei Tjong", "primary_group_name": null, "flair_name": null, "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": null, "flair_color": null, "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_wiki": false, "link_counts": [{"url": "http://urho3d.github.io", "internal": false, "reflection": false, "title": "Urho3D - Cross-platform 2D and 3D game engine", "clicks": 0}], "read": true, "user_title": "Admin", "title_is_group": false, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [], "moderator": false, "admin": true, "staff": true, "user_id": 4, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 4, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false}, {"id": 4750, "name": "", "username": "Bluemoon", "avatar_template": "/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/bluemoon/{size}/348_2.png", "created_at": "2015-02-14T07:44:30.000Z", "cooked": "<p>I believe this wiki will go a long way in helping new comers get to terms with the nuts and bolts of Urho3d\u2026 I don\u2019t mind devoting my time contributing <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>", "post_number": 24, "post_type": 1, "updated_at": "2017-01-02T01:03:26.119Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 0, "reads": 8, "readers_count": 7, "score": 1.6, "yours": false, "topic_id": 760, "topic_slug": "urho-wiki", "display_username": "", "primary_group_name": null, "flair_name": null, "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": null, "flair_color": null, "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": true, "user_title": null, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 94, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 2, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false}, {"id": 4751, "name": "gawag AKA damu", "username": "gawag", "avatar_template": "/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/gawag/{size}/68_2.png", "created_at": "2015-02-14T08:19:01.000Z", "cooked": "<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/weitjong\">@weitjong</a>:<br>\nI already knew what you meant. But also with a normal moderation team: \u201cwe will check every change before it is made public\u201d sounds more serious and like needing to double check everything or needing a higher skill before contributing, and may make it less likely for someone to contribute. I have no real experience with moderating wikis or similiar, but I would try to keep it open at first and restrict when its getting out of hand. Though I also had experience with spammers and likelihood of reverting bad changes vs. likelihood of someone not contributing due to being less open may be higher as I\u2019m currently guessing.<br>\nI Ogre wiki was open for every change. Which really surprised me at that time. I could change things and that was directly visible for everyone.<br>\nBoth models require moderation, either checking for bad changes or checking every incoming material.<br>\nAh! It may be a good idea to give someone the right to contribute directly (without having to wait for clearance) after making a few good changes (like 3-5 good changes maybe). That would make working efficiently possible and keep spammers out. Though new stuff needs still to be at least a bit checked, not only for trolls/spammers, but also for accidental errors.</p>\n<p>There seems to be quite some interest in the wiki, though most has been done by me until now. I just fixed an error / wrong assumption about Urho3D. The wiki needs more experienced users. I just started with Urho a few days ago (though knowing other engines like Ogre quite a bit).<br>\nThe wiki contains already quite some good ideas about helpful content. Those could be implemented, commented or expanded.<br>\nIt may also be a good idea to know if someone is already working on something, like working on a sample project, before another one does the same at the same time.

Our wiki on GitHub was disabled due to lack of community content at the time. Since now you are going to move out from Wikia anyway and you have already some good content, it is a no-brainer to re-enable it so that you can park your content there. As for our old wiki on Google Code, it was not wiki content at all. We didn\u2019t have main website (GitHub pages) at that time, so what were there was in fact just the early incarnation of our online documentation today.</p>\n<p>You can of course choose not to move your content to our wiki on GitHub.

Our wiki on GitHub was disabled due to lack of community content at the time.

As for our old wiki on Google Code, it was not wiki content at all. We didn\u2019t have main website (GitHub pages) at that time, so what were there was in fact just the early incarnation of our online documentation today.</p>\n<p>You can of course choose not to move your content to our wiki on GitHub.

Although on paper it should work.[/quote]</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know how powerful such a GitHub wiki would be and how easy or complicated to use. Wikia had various issues that made it more complicated as it should have been, like having two different editors with both having various issues. I think that\u2019s one of the things that slower/hindered more people in participating.<br>\nThe new wiki is a mediawiki and uses the VisualEditor which makes editing pretty easy and straightforward. The only thing really bugging me is the more difficult integration of images, one has to upload images in one place and insert the filename manually somewhere completely different, even Wikia made that better. I\u2019ve asked about that in their support but no answer yet. Also the VisualEditor could be better with handling tables and other \u201cmore advanced\u201d stuff, some things have to be done in markup.<br>\nThe new wiki is at <a href=\"https://urho3d.miraheze.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">urho3d.miraheze.org/</a>. It\u2019s not yet configured as I want it to be (like the \u201cMain Page\u201d title still being there), most content has not been moved as I just started yesterday and not every new idea has been (fully) implemented. There\u2019s one completely new article and some new links I found.<br>\nI could also give you (the main \u201cUrho3D-Guys\u201d) admin access (I guess) and we could turn that (or something else) to the \u201cofficial wiki\u201d. There are not that many settings but one can request specific settings or additional extensions at their request page. You could play around at <a href=\"https://urho3d.miraheze.org/wiki/Sandbox\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">urho3d.miraheze.org/wiki/Sandbox</a>, there\u2019s a neat syntax highlighting (accessible also directly from the VisualEditor) and video embedding possibility. Mediawiki (or others) is far more powerful as Github Wiki, which would have advantages obviously.<br>\nI compared various offers and Miraheze seemed the best, but also not without flaws as I found out later. Like the Media Manager displaying images from all of their wikis and not just this Urho3D wiki. I also tried selfhosting mediawiki, which worked, but I couldn\u2019t get a good (visual) editor running without modifying that server too heavily (ridiculous dependencies and wrong Linux distribution).</p>\n<p>How would that GitHub \u201ccontent push request management\u201d work?<br>\nWhat about policy? The \u201cUnofficial Wiki\u201d was/is not just about Urho but about more general (game) development topics as well, to act as one entry point/hub into the whole game dev area.<br>\nOgre\u2019s wiki for example contains also various extensions to Ogre like weather/water/terrain/grass/GUI systems with Ogre wrapper but that wiki is also often ridiculously outdated (but even those old articles are idea-wise still useful to an extend).<br>\nWhat ideas&amp;plans are there?<br>\nOne of my main points is ease of participation to get more community work going. I also would like to help organize the community a bit better like having lists of current projects going on regarding Urho and games/stuff using Urho, projects needing certain thing, other projects having various things (like a weather system that could be shared, under certain non-free conditions perhaps<span class=\"bbcode-b\">**</span> too). A forum is good for discussions, GitHub good for hosting projects, a wiki could help document and connect stuff.</p>\n<p>Ogre, Crystalspace and other engines do have project galleries on their sites (often with terrible and old stuff there though). I still see Urho3D as being more capable and easier as Crystalspace and Ogre (yeah Ogre is just 3D but still). The usage of Urho does not reflect that at all and it\u2019s pretty unknown. That\u2019s also one of the reasons I\u2019m working on those \u201cSample Projects\u201d. Having simple but still neat example (and free software) games in various genres would be great to show of and to also start own projects (user perspective) in similar directions.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t have a real overview of the Urho community. There seem to be 3-4+ core developers putting seemingly like all of their time into the free engine. I read there was a shooter game in development but abandoned and Urho emerged from that. Are the core (or other more active) developer working on games as their jobs? Besides those core developers there seem to be a heavily fluctuating amount of hobbyists (often still in school/university) playing around a bit with Urho but often dropping it again quite soon due to lack of time.<br>\nAs already mentioned somewhere here, I\u2019m working as a (mainly) C++ software developer on image editing software made with Qt and deployed to Windows and Mac (media industry is like half Windows half Mac\u2026). I started playing around with (game) development when I was like 14 and still have a lot of ideas regarding games. There\u2019s nearly no game where I\u2019m not like \u201cOh I could make that thing better, that\u2019s a bad idea there, this would be better different\u2026\u201d. There are now a lot of indie games made by often just a handful or just one guy with great new ideas, these games are often selling for 5$-15$ on steam with high ratings (no idea how much they sell of those though). I could also imagine going (partly or fully) into such a indie-ish game scene, currently I\u2019m doing all that Urho stuff just as a \u201chobby\u201d. Though that wiki work I accidentally stumbled into often feels more like work, one kinda has the obligation to keep ones articles up to date and ones projects going. I also see it as a moral obligation to give-back to the free software community when earning money by using the work of so many volunteers, so this is kinda currently my part of doing that.</p>\n<p><span class=\"bbcode-b\">**</span> Whoops: wrote \u201ceventually\u201d there instead \u201cperhaps\u201d.

Other ideas regarding the wiki?<br>\nLike the Wikia wiki has articles about creating textures with Blender, like using a 4 dimensional generator I worked on for like a week to get seamless generic textures. Other articles may be about shaders with just a bit of Urho or purely theoretical articles about game dev (topics). I also have stuff and ideas lying around about general C++ articles (may be also interesting for game dev), though I don\u2019t even know If that would fit onto the \u201cUnofficial Wiki\u201d.<br>\nGithub is usually quite project focused, hm.<br>\nWhat about assets like models made for Urho and sharing those? There could be a sharing area like Unity has. There are special sites for models, textures and stuff but there\u2019s also Urho\u2019s scene format and models could be pre converted for Urho and shaders written or adapted for Urho. Something like that would have greatly helped me with my test/sample projects. One has to crawl other pages for hours to find suitable models for a game engine with a proper license and more hours to \u201cfix them\u201d and to get them into Urho (blender files (or similar) could be packed with the assets too).</p>\n<p>Having a wiki on Github may look more like official documentation or an internal wiki and not that inviting to the community. There are already many people saying \u201coh I don\u2019t know enough to write about Urho/something\u201d.<br>\nI\u2019m still surprised that there were several people saying \u201coh a wiki would be so cool and I would totally participate\u201d and then not that much was done by others than me. Though the last time I checked Ogre the wiki seemed also relatively inactive.<br>\nI started writing articles about stuff I was just figuring out and still have often no idea if that\u2019s the proper way of using Urho. Others didn\u2019t even fix my typos, so much for \u201ccommunity work\u201d\u2026 Would be good if more experienced or even core developers could at least give a bit of input here and there or fix bad practices or something.</p>\n<p>Hm\u2026 What about the state of the community in general? What could they want from an Urho wiki or something in that direction?<br>\nWhat is already around? What is needed? On what are various people working? It\u2019s hard doing anything with an engine when one has to do so much by themself. In Ogre I could combine various extensions that already offered a lot (though they collided with each other in my case and everything was usually outdated).<br>\nI still don\u2019t know if there are any usable extensions to Urho. Like Ogre had extensions for water (Hydrax, \u2026), for time &amp; weather effects (Sky- something), for grass, plants and similar (PagedGeometry), alternative terrain engines (ETM: Editable Terrain Manager, \u2026), for GUIs (CeGUI, MyGUI, \u2026), \u2026<br>\nI started working on a simple weather thing in my first test project to get a day-night-cycle and clouds, it kinda worked but not that good.<br>\nI also tried getting grass and trees on terrain, didn\u2019t manage to get something good and fast.<br>\nCurrently I\u2019m quite focused on my GUI project, though it\u2019s not just for Urho and there\u2019s no Urho wrapper yet, but it should be easy to make one. (yeah Urho has already something like a GUI but I don\u2019t like that and don\u2019t like Qt so I\u2019m trying to make a better alternative for at least some basic and custom stuff.)</p>\n<p>What about updating the Urho samples (the ones shipped with it)? They are the first things the user sees. As already written in my first post ever here: the textures are super low res, there\u2019s a <span class=\"bbcode-b\">ninja</span> with a <span class=\"bbcode-b\">sword</span> throwing <span class=\"bbcode-b\">snowballs</span>, \u2026 The samples could be made nicer with using the features the engine already has, like better textures with normal and specular maps, more fitting and nicer models, maybe a proper car in the car sample and with rocks and/or trees instead of giant shrooms\u2026<br>\nUrho is wasting potential.</p>", "post_number": 58, "post_type": 1, "updated_at": "2017-01-02T01:09:41.091Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 1, "incoming_link_count": 15, "reads": 12, "readers_count": 11, "score": 77.4, "yours": false, "topic_id": 760, "topic_slug": "urho-wiki", "display_username": "gawag AKA damu", "primary_group_name": null, "flair_name": null, "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": null, "flair_color": null, "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": true, "user_title": null, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 206, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false}, {"id": 9872, "name": "", "username": "valera_rozuvan", "avatar_template": "https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/v/46a35a/{size}.png", "created_at": "2016-01-27T11:35:02.000Z", "cooked": "<p>Just thought about being the first to add something to the <span class=\"bbcode-b\">Urho3D GitHub wiki</span>\u2026 decided to go the path of creating pages that will explain how to install Urho3D on Linux and on Windows.

There are several discussions about materials/shaders but often without providing a really working sample, just a discussion. Something like a material library would be great. For example shaders for triplanar texture mapping, I found that method somewhere and managed to write own shaders, I think I wrote articles about that on the \u201cWikia wiki\u201d. There\u2019s also an article about parallax occlusion mapping. All those articles and more could be bundled and a gallery with working materials and shaders be made. Would be super helpful.

Like shader development with Urho (as Urho is a bit different) or modifying the rendering pipeline (if that\u2019s realistically needed for \u201cnormal\u201d games). The old Unofficial Urho Wiki does have a Blender to Urho Tutorial to bind Blender Tutorials together with Urho such stuff could be expanded.<br>\nSomething like \u201cLet\u2019s make a (simple) game XY with Urho\u201d-Series would be great as well (can be written or video, video would have the disadvantage of not being searchable and fast readable, could be written and with small embedded videos).</p>\n<p>Do we have someone who could participate to some kind of wiki article stuff or something?

Don\u2019t want to hijack this tread, but here are a couple of examples from past week or 2.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Screen Re-sizing: Spent some time getting scaling under control, then noticed that when I resized the screen, the mouse would go crazy. Dug around this forum and saw it had been reported and quickly fixed in a nightly release. I haven?t verified it (staying with the 1.5 release for now), but assume it was fixed and allowed me to move on. This is very good, but took a few hours to find that info. Would be good if a user (dummy) friendly ongoing bug list was kept, organized into various categories or easily searchable, etc\u2026 Just takes too much digging now.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the things I did want to do was limit the screen size a user can adjust to. There does not appear to be in the API anyway for the code to adjust or set the screen size. We can read it, but not set it. Gave up on that for now. I\u2019m a long way from digging into anything deeper that what the API provides (becomes an ongoing support issue too).</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Sound Delay:  There appears to be a delay in the sound system. I have setup a simple \u201chit\u201d ping when collisions occur, and there is a real concerning delay. I\u2019m just using simple collision messaging to detect that, so was thinking I needed to get more sophisticated about it anyway to avoid double hits, etc. (you mentioned that on your wiki), checking frames or using ray tracing, etc., but not sure what the best approach to tracking collisions really is (in general or my specifics). There seems to be quite a few ways. Thought I\u2019d change that and see if it helps my sound delay, but not convinced it will. Not sure where the issue really is. Urho3D has a few ways to approach sound also (at least when 3D is involved) and I\u2019ve only tried the simplest one I\u2019ve found (again, notes from your wiki).  Maybe there is a way to prioritize this over that?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I still am spending quite a bit of time changing my development environment around. Think that comes with the flexibility Urho3D offers. One thing related is the dependencies for release. Depending upon your environment and the target (just different versions of Windows for example), it seems that various .dll\u2019s are needed (VCxxy, or D3Dxx, etc.). No clear list of \u201cthis for that\u201d that I\u2019ve found.

Would be good if a user (dummy) friendly ongoing bug list was kept, organized into various categories or easily searchable, etc\u2026 Just takes too much digging now.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One of the things I did want to do was limit the screen size a user can adjust to. There does not appear to be in the API anyway for the code to adjust or set the screen size. We can read it, but not set it. Gave up on that for now. I\u2019m a long way from digging into anything deeper that what the API provides (becomes an ongoing support issue too).</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Hm can\u2019t find anything regarding setting the screen size either. The engine has these startup parameters where one can set the size <a href=\"http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.5/class_urho3_d_1_1_engine.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">urho3d.github.io/documentation/1 \u2026 ngine.html</a>. Not sure if that can be only done at startup:</p>\n<p><code>engineParameters_[\"FullScreen\"]=false;\nengineParameters_[\"WindowWidth\"]=1280;\nengineParameters_[\"WindowHeight\"]=720;\nengineParameters_[\"WindowResizable\"]=true;</code><br>\nBTW there\u2019s an event for changes in the screen mode, like the user resizing the window:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">    SubscribeToEvent(Urho3D::E_SCREENMODE,URHO3D_HANDLER(gui,e_resize));\n...\n    void e_resize(Urho3D::StringHash eventType,Urho3D::VariantMap&amp; eventData)\n    {\n        int w=eventData[Urho3D::ScreenMode::P_WIDTH].GetInt();\n        int h=eventData[Urho3D::ScreenMode:].GetInt();\n        lfgui::widget::resize(w,h);\n    }</code></pre>\n<p>Maybe the Engine::ParseParameters (const Vector&lt; String &gt; &amp;arguments) can be called again during runtime to change stuff like the resolution? The Application class is feeding the parameters to the engine in the constructor I guess.</p>\n<p>[quote=\u201cdvan\u201d]<br>\n2. Sound Delay:  There appears to be a delay in the sound system. I have setup a simple \u201chit\u201d ping when collisions occur, and there is a real concerning delay. I\u2019m just using simple collision messaging to detect that, so was thinking I needed to get more sophisticated about it anyway to avoid double hits, etc. (you mentioned that on your wiki), checking frames or using ray tracing, etc., but not sure what the best approach to tracking collisions really is (in general or my specifics). There seems to be quite a few ways. Thought I\u2019d change that and see if it helps my sound delay, but not convinced it will. Not sure where the issue really is. Urho3D has a few ways to approach sound also (at least when 3D is involved) and I\u2019ve only tried the simplest one I\u2019ve found (again, notes from your wiki).  Maybe there is a way to prioritize this over that?[/quote]<br>\nI haven\u2019t noticed any sound delay in my projects. At least not when the sound is properly edited (starting immediately at the start and not like 0.1 seconds in, which is not really noticeable by hearing when playing the sound outside of a realtime application like a game). Maybe it\u2019s a collision (notification) delay? I haven\u2019t done any 2D stuff.<br>\nI mentioned avoiding double hits in the wiki?<br>\nOh maybe there are multiple collisions detected before your objects have pushed away each other and you start your sound multiple times and it only starts properly after the last noticed collision. Like playing the first silent 0.01 seconds multiple times before it gets to a hearable part at like 0.1s or something. You could have a bool that saves if there already was a collision in the last frame and you only start the sound if there was no collision previously (they just collided).</p>\n<p>[quote=\u201cdvan\u201d]<br>\nI still am spending quite a bit of time changing my development environment around. Think that comes with the flexibility Urho3D offers. One thing related is the dependencies for release. Depending upon your environment and the target (just different versions of Windows for example), it seems that various .dll\u2019s are needed (VCxxy, or D3Dxx, etc.). No clear list of \u201cthis for that\u201d that I\u2019ve found. Lots of scattered notes, and some of them are probably dated by now.[/quote]<br>\nYes that also confuses me. On windows 10 (not sure about 7) one seems to have to install the June 2010 DirectX Runtime Thing to run Urho applications build with DirectX9, but nothing (at least not with MinGW) seems to be required to build that. DirectX11 could also require (only) this 2010 DirectX Runtime, not sure currently.</p>\n<p>[quote=\u201cweitjong\u201d]<br>\nI am glad to hear that you are at least considering to participate in the wiki on GitHub. Note that we/I have never pronounced it as \u201cofficial wiki\u201d. As for all the other questions you asked, if I may sum them all up in one sentence then you are asking about our \u201cwiki roadmap\u201d[?] If so, then I don\u2019t have the answer also. The fact is, if you even ask what is the Urho3D development roadmap then none of us will be able to give you any definitely answer, let alone the roadmap for the wiki itself. The wiki pages should be read and written by any of us, so I would like to think that the answers are already available in each of us. It should grow organically by itself without much governing control.</p>\n<p>Enough talking. Our wiki did not get any traction in the past, I think, because it did not have a good start and none of the core developers got involved. So this time round, I promise to spend some time to seed the wiki with some \u201cGetting Started\u201d articles for each target platform: Linux, Android, Rasperry-Pi, Windows, OSX, iOS, and tvOS (yes Apple tvOS is coming real soon). After that, we will see from there.[/quote]<br>\nOh that sounds way better as I expected.  <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=10\" title=\":smiley:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":smiley:\"> I somehow expected you being mad again about something\u2026<br>\nI just started a Wishlist which I had planed anyway: <a href=\"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/wiki/Wishlist\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/wiki/Wishlist</a><br>\nI could make articles about the first two entries as I did both things before. No idea if that will be the best way though. And no real idea about the other things, I just wrote things down that would be nice to know.</p>\n<p>That GitHub Wiki is practically build into the Urho3D website that\u2019s why we called it the Official Wiki. It\u2019s practically saying \u201cthis is our wiki\u201d which makes it the \u201cmain wiki\u201d like the Ogre Wiki which is linked directly to from the main Ogre site.<br>\nYes I was asking about if there is some kind of \u201cwiki roadmap\u201d or some ideas regarding it. I thought there would be some ideas in you or other core devs.<br>\nThere\u2019s no Urho roadmap either? Nothing like \u201coh we wanted to do X and that wasn\u2019t possible with existing engines\u201d or \u201cIn contrast to Ogre (or whatever) we want to do Y differently\u201d.<br>\nIt it just playing around without a goal? I just discovered <a href=\"http://gamedev.net\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">gamedev.net</a> and Lasse ??rni / cadaver / AgentC being active there (the Urho3D project starter? no idea about the history and motivations behind the main devs). He seems to play around with various engines and performance stuff here and there: <a href=\"http://www.gamedev.net/user/82042-agentc/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">gamedev.net/user/82042-agentc/</a></p>\n<p>About me and my \u201cgoals\u201d.<br>\nI found Urho3D as I was searching for a free software and free engine, coming from mixed experience with Irrlicht, CrystalSpace and Ogre (I already got into more detail about that in for example my first post in this forum). Basically the engines I tried before Urho3D didn\u2019t work at all (Irrlicht) or not with MinGW on Windows (Ogre stopped supporting that years ago in their stable version) or had broken physics and graphics (Crystalspace) or got too inactive (Irrlicht, Crystalspace and Ogre). Ogre seems to be kinda active under the hood and to have switched to CMake which may make MinGW available again but it\u2019s still just a 3D engine and integrating sound and physic was possible but made using it unnecessary complicated. Ogre was the best of those three but had also so much outdated stuff like their libraries which are often still listed but no longer working (already years ago and still today).<br>\nSo I came to Urho3D. I could built and use it with MinGW! Shadows were working (Crystalspace had broken ones back than)! It has physics integrated (I had ODE and/or Bullet combined with Ogre before but that was a mess)! And there were some \u201cadvanced\u201d materials already available like bump/normal mapping (I had to manually write a weird normal mapping shader for Ogre)!</p>\n<p>I read there\u2019s some activity towards this Physics Based Rendering that some modern games have. Would be good to have some kind of list of features that are being actively worked on. The GitHub Issues contain a bit but with unknown status.<br>\nThere is some community activity in various field like integrating a better GUI and making more materials but I\u2019m not sure if anything usable came out of any of that. The thread that I started in that direction is still empty  <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/frowning.png?v=10\" title=\":frowning:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":frowning:\">  <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/confused.png?v=10\" title=\":confused:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":confused:\"> : <a href=\"http://discourse.urho3d.io/t/urho3d-ressources/1763/1\">post10657.html</a></p>\n<p>I have various game ideas and started playing with Urho which yielded these one and a half public sample projects <a href=\"https://github.com/LFGUI/LFGUI\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">github.com/LFGUI/LFGUI</a>. So much for my stuff. I think I wrote most of that already multiple times here\u2026 Would be nice to see what others are working on or towards. I guess no one would answer If I ask somewhere.<br>\nWhat I want is practically a free and usable engine. Usable with C++ and MinGW. Doesn\u2019t have to be the fastest one but performance should be \u201cgood enough\u201d. It should also be not complicated to use.
