Has anyone actually used the implementation of p2p from the replication sample? Are there any thirdparty solutions that save the headaches? I don’t even care about having a dedicated server. I just want a way for friends to connect and host (even if they have to tell each other their ip over the phone or something). Is there a viable commercial solution to make this work better?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarthest I got using the sample was:\u003cbr\u003e\nClient Connected\u003cbr\u003e\nand then immediately after: Client Disconnected\u003cbr\u003e\netc\u003cbr\u003e\n(with a bunch of tries before failing totally)\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is based off the Sample with the ball thing running a server with digital ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I just do two pcs, seperate networks, and I run an unmodified SceneReplication sample, it just won’t ever connect. I know there is a p2p multiplayer helper project by Arnis which I’m grateful for but unfortunately the setup is way over my head. Also, I don’t see why the sample method doesn’t work. I’ve spent far too many hours messing with digital ocean trying to get two applications to connect. One person can connect, but not a second one. I’ve tried everything I could think of as far as opening ports and all that. I don’t have networking issues with other p2p games though (alien-arena, for example just works without issues). I’m worried something about the way urho does it is the problem. No idea how to troubleshoot this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocalhost works (running the application multiple times on the same pc always replicates and allows all clients in).
