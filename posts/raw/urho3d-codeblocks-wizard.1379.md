CodeBlocks has project templates for Ogre3D and Irrlicht so I thought of making one for Urho3D to ease me getting a project quickly set up and running.
Here is the link to the Urho3D project wizard template for CodeBlocks

 :confused:  Unfortunately it currently takes care of OpenGL, D3D9 and D3D11 using Mingw-w64 on Windows though as time goes by support would be added for MSVC and other OS platforms.

UPDATE:
Discovered a bug when using it in the latest nightly builds of CodeBlocks, project files are not generated. I will rectify this very soon

UPDATE:
Bug has been rectified
