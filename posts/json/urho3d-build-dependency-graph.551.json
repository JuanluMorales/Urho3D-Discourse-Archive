Ninja is a replacement build system for makefiles, same task, it is just not for humans to write, it is designed to be generated by machines, like by CMake, and it is extremely fast compared to make with a lot of features from distribution to graph generation.  I have my local Urho3D cmake_gcc.sh file modified to default to “Ninja” instead of “Unix Makefiles” to help my build time and I use a few of its features.
