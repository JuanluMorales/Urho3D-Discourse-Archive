Hey guys,

Just thought of adding another showcase in this section for Urho3D capabilities, so here's the short sample video of the Extended Snow War extended version that I did last year. The implementation is still rough and I have not touched this since:

- Players w/ Friendly AI (VS) Enemy AI (Blue/Green vs Red)
- Team Scoring
- Demo Chat Integration (?/? key) with Live Game Stats (kill/killed/joined/left)
- Round Timer (experimental)
- Text 2D Player/AI IDs with team color
- Random AI ID/Name

cheers. :slight_smile:
