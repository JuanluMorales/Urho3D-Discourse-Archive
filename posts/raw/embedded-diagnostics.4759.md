CivetWeb based embedded server.

I'm no web-developer so it's probably not the greatest implementation. Does it's job however, inspect data/results, run commands, etc and generally stay out of the way. Still a fair number of QoL things to do, but the objective is to not drift off into super-tool land.

Should just be drop-in, rerun CMake, and start using. Do take note of the `web` folder that contains the local files for templates and bootstrap/jquery/etc dependencies.
