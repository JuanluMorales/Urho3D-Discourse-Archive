Hi, urhofans.

I would like to use graphic fonts made in photoshop in my project. Is there an easy way to implement this?

Thank you very much!  :smiley:

The Urho3D built-in UI subystem supports bitmap font too, if that is what you are looking for. See [urho3d.github.io/documentation/H ... l#UI_Fonts](http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_u_i.html#UI_Fonts)
