Just saw this today and thought it might be worth considering as a possible alternative to Urho's graphics engine or as a reference to implement some of the features in Urho: [https://github.com/google/filament/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/google/filament/blob/master/README.md)
Of course, I didn't actually read anything beyond the readme, so I can't actually vouch for it, but it seemed interesting from what I saw.

It would be nice to use spirv-cross for a single shader language.
