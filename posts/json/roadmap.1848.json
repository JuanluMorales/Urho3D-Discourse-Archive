There can also be multiple developers, possible working on or being “responsible” for different things. That you are “reacting to issues and pull requests” is of course pretty great, that doesn’t have to change necessarily. There could be others (there kinda are already) who are progressing Urho in specific areas and adding features and who don’t have to know every area. Not sure how such a system is called but “area guys” are often called something like “module maintainer”. The Linux (the kernel) development is managed in such a way, with most core developers being responsible for specific areas. Like a company with department heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany projects die due to not having someone maintaining the whole thing.

Some other engines like this Unity seem to have various modules that are plugged together to build a game. I’m not familiar with those systems but I’ve used Ogre which had some libraries/modules that could be used to (more or less easily) get nice water with waves, day-night with nice effects, editable terrain (Ogre’s normal terrain is/was static), good performance vegetation/geometry via chunks, … These Ogre “modules” though often didn’t really work well together. Like the grass I had was z-fighting with the water, the sea ground was visible when looking through transparent grass (such things could have been easily fixable though).\u003cbr\u003e\nSome of such features/modules are better kept separate, others could be integrated into Urho. Some libraries/modules may required additions or changes to Urho itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch libraries/modules could also be called “external features”.
