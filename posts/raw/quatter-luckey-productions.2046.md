[url=https://luckeyproductions.itch.io/quatter][b]Quatter[/b][/url] is a FOSS clone of the [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarto_%28board_game%29]Quarto[/url] board game by Blaise M?ller.
Quarto became popular in my family more than ten years ago after my father crafted several boards and pieces from wood. A championship was held at a family reunion and the winners were rewarded with one of these handcrafted games. Earlier this year my niece told me her brother was making a set out of metal. Seeing how this year is also Quarto?s 25th anniversary I decided to create a version using Urho3D.
