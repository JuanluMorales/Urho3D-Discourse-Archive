This will also prevent issues from attempting to use the Connection retrieved from GetOwner() when someone disconnects (Unless I’m mistaken here?).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I made the appropriate changes, I can no longer compile.

You will need to make sure that the WeakPtr is not manipulated in any way from the header, not even .Get(), or from other files that don’t actually include Connection.h.

It just seems weird to me that we’re relying on manual assignment instead of reference counting like the rest of the engine. IMO it would be preferably that there isn’t a hierarchy of libraries, that Network and Scene both work completely independently of each-other and maintain their own internal state. If one needs access to the other, it would use WeakPtrs and Events to communicate available information. Just a pipe dream I suppose, the engine’s great either way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I’ve figured out what I need to change in my code to get it working reliably.
