Might go left or right, front or back) without sliding (remaining in their original collision position)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee picture for visual, top part shows what I’m trying to achieve while the bottom shows what exactly happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg

height=\"500\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was trying to use constraints but with the collision enabled node wouldn’t even move, with collision disabled the node was rotating around the point (main problem here is that there is no collision with the node below)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncreasing restitution makes it even more awkward and unrealistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could create several point-to-point constraints and active them as required (depending on node rotation), maybe checking for position on update and rectifying as required or is there a different approach I should take?\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2018-02-21T18:43:59.863Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":15,"reads":40,"readers_count":39,"score":83.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":4031,"topic_slug":"3d-physics-constraint-problem","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":216,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":23373,"name":"kabu","username":"johnnycable","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/johnnycable/{size}/788_2.png","created_at":"2018-02-21T20:38:06.332Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eWhat’s
