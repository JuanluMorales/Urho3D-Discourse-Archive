Greetings.
I am a noob and I want to use c# with rbfx.
I am trying to build this engine from source code,but there are problems.
I am using vs2017 and I have installed .net framework 4.7.1-4.7.2.
But cmake point out it can not find dot net execute file.I don't know what it is.I searched my computer but there was nothing called "dotnet.exe".
So I installed .net 6.0,then I can add "dotnet.exe" filepath to cmake,then I can generate project with cmake.But vs2017 can not recognize .net 6.0.
Then I installed vs2022.
But it can not build eastl.lib.
I like this project and I really want to try it.So any advice pleaseï¼Ÿ
Thanks a lot!

When I build rbfx I encounter errors that I have to fix myself before it builds successfully, although I don't recall the exact changes I made. It was simple stuff like missing includes.

Is there an error message being output when it fails to build eastl?

Looks like the same error as reported here, with a suggested fix.
