Apparently whoever designed the Urho2D system locks all UV coordinate to integers, which are then multiplied with 0.0999999… (0.1 not represented accurately due to floating point), which then causes issues with the side pixels leaking since they never actually shifted the inward a little to compensate for the floating point inaccuracy.  This combined with the fact that Urho2D does nonsensical precision losing things like:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003e    float invWidth = 1.0f / (float)texture_-\u0026gt;GetWidth();\n    float invHeight = 1.0f / (float)texture_-\u0026gt;GetHeight();\n\n    rect.min_.x_ = rectangle_.left_ * invWidth;\n    rect.max_.x_ = rectangle_.right_ * invWidth;\n\n    rect.min_.y_ = rectangle_.bottom_ * invHeight;\n    rect.max_.y_ = rectangle_.top_ * invHeight;\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCauses it to slowly hemorrhage accuracy as far as I can tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, first question, why is this bound to integers instead of floating for UV’s, and why is it scaling UV’s one way, then the other, losing accuracy?

change, and that should only affect what happens on image edges, and as this is a spritesheet then it is not getting to those edges anyway since I am using a tiny part of the sheet.  I was able to fix it by massaging Sprite2d.cpp’s GetTextureRectangle function output (shifting UV’s tiny-bit inwards), but that only works for my sizes and would not work generically.  Need to overhaul Urho2D to get rid of that friggin PIXEL_SIZE and have UV’s use 0.0-1.0 floats instead of integers that lose precision.  Why was that style picked anyway?  It will not scale as I allow different texture sizes to override things, the very design of Urho2D taking integer UV’s makes no sense…\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":4,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:10:57.032Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":1,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":14,"readers_count":13,"score":2.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":1868,"topic_slug":"urho2d-texture-clipping-issue","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":42,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":10898,"name":"","username":"OvermindDL1","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/o/a8b319/{size}.png","created_at":"2016-03-13T20:23:33.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eSpecifically this is what I did:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReplace in file Sprite2D.cpp starting at line 172 from this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003e    rect.min_.x_ = rectangle_.left_ * invWidth;\n    rect.max_.x_ = rectangle_.right_ * invWidth;\n\n    rect.min_.y_ = rectangle_.bottom_ * invHeight;\n    rect.max_.y_ = rectangle_.top_ * invHeight;\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo become this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003e    rect.min_.x_ = rectangle_.left_ * invWidth + 0.0001;\n    rect.max_.x_ = rectangle_.right_ * invWidth - 0.0001;\n\n    rect.min_.y_ = rectangle_.bottom_ * invHeight + 0.0001;\n    rect.max_.y_ = rectangle_.top_ * invHeight - 0.0001;\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough not generic or properly done, it does fix the spritesheet rendering issues in 99% of cases (which is more than what the spritesheet supports now), and would consequently fix sprites so that the CLAMP mode being force-set in code is likely not necessary anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would be amenable to that being put in master as it does resolve a few issues (though still not done ‘properly’, though the proper way involves getting rid of the integer UV addressing and go back to floats, even if it is scaled to pixels).
