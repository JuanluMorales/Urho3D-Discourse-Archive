I’m only interested when nodes for those are created and destroyed. I believe I could easily calculate everything between those using the initial velocity and position on the client side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it’s not possible and this sounds like a terrible idea, do you have any alternative ideas how to implement it? One that comes to my mind is to keep projectiles always local and create them to client side using remote events. I would also need some unique names so I could later destroy the right projectile with another remote event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it’s not possible and you think it might be good idea, I can try to write a PR for Urho3D.
