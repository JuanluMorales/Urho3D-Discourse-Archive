Maybe this is a non issue, as it is a small message, but still it bothers me that all players on one side of the world need to be notified immediately by every new or removed node or player on the other. Any way around this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, more worrisome, I do not want to force all users to get all content packages in the scene, but rather have it sent to them by their proximity, similar to network priority (distance). As I understood it, package must be declared required for a scene and then it gets replicated. Is there a way to send a package only by some arbitrary logic to each client? I guess I can create my own message type and just SendMessage, but it seems shame not to use Packaging features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it a problem for a scene to have tens of thousands of nodes? Or hundreds of player client connections? Network fps could be low 4-5fps, and most replicated nodes and players would always be outside of replicated distance for any player.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr is there maybe different approach to use multiple scenes on server (e.g. for each player) and then do some manual server side node sync for each? Or maybe create separate scenes on client just for world/content delivery and render both in parallel?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than these few unknowns, I think Urho3d could be perfect for it!  \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=5\" title=\":smiley:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":smiley:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:13:52.547Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":109,"reads":21,"readers_count":20,"score":549.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":2199,"topic_slug":"mmo-considerations","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":531,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":13340,"name":"Lasse Öörni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2016-08-22T22:23:49.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eWelcome to the forums.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe networking part has been written as a guess of what may be useful in a server-authoritative multiplayer game. It has been tested by rather small applications, like the NinjaSnowWar example. It’s somewhat leaning on the idea of a realtime action game with a small(ish) amount of players.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor MMO use, I recommend to be at least prepared to roll your own networking solution, if necessary. For any performance figures (number of connections / objects and such), I can only say that try to prototype with as little work as possible, to see if the Urho built-in networking is feasible at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout the networked resource packages, this system have been written with the idea of a typical small multiplayer game with a map cycle, the idea being that before joining a map, you get the resources it needs. Urho lacks the concept of “pending” or “waiting” resources, which may pose a problem if you are streaming in the content of a continuous world via packages. In case a package download is late, and you would already need the resources by a game object (for example a StaticModel component), you’ll just get an error log print as the StaticModel tries to assign non-existing models/materials, and it forgets those assignments, so it will not retry when the resources actually are available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the realXtend virtual world application framework, which was first implemented on top of Ogre3D and then later as a minimal Urho port (see \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/realXtend/tundra-urho3d\"\u003egithub.com/realXtend/tundra-urho3d\u003c/a\u003e) a custom network-aware asset system was written on top of the underlying engine, and only ready assets would be fed to the engine/renderer.

But this seems like high-quality problem which is not very likely to happen in real world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be honest I don’t feel too happy/excited about implementing my own replication and content delivery protocol. Main reason is that I did that once already (in Marmalade) and while it did work out at the end, I am pretty sure Urho3D does networking way better. Same is certainly also true for 3d graphics and physics, which is also part of the reason of why I am migrating. So now, I would really rather focus on game building than on engine building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I would like to try and tweak the Connection/Network a bit to fit my needs.

This way we could have worlds huge, clients thin, high number of players and low bandwidth making it great for MMOs.
