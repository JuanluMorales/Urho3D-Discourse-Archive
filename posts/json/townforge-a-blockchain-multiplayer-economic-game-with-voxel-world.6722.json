The core is an economic game, where creating buildings costs money and you try to get more income from those buildings than you spent in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expenses and income from those buildings are recorded on the chain, and are thus made in “real” money which can be exchanged between players (and mined as a normal blockchain). There is a builtin chat, decentralized marketplace, and a player may specialize in various ways to make a living in the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a 3D world that goes with it, where players can optionally build freestyle models for their buildings, Minecraft style. The terrain is procedurally generated and practically infinite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing based on a blockchain, this is an inherently multiplayer game, and it is currently in testnet (ie, beta) so any currency mined at the moment will be erased once the final mainnet starts.
