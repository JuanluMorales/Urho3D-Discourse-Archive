Hi,

While reading about attribute animation in the [url=https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.6/_attribute_animation.html]docs[/url] it is mentioned that attribute animations can be loaded from xml files but i couldn't find any documentation or reference about the xml definition for attribute animation. What i'm looking for is something similar to the definition for renderpaths at the bottom of [url=https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.6/_render_paths.html]this page[/url]. Is this documented somewhere or should i just look at the related classes and their corresponding "LoadXML" methods?

Thanks

My recommendation is to create an animation in code, save it and see what it looks like. Documentation contributions are welcome; there some gaps like that.
