there are also some pugins for blender and 3d studio max and gimp but i didnt test them. 
You can download Eskil Steenberg's dev tools (3d Modeler ... ) on his side [url]http://www.quelsolaar.com/love/index.html[/url].
They are free and with source code! 

here is a gif how my implementation is working with urho3d :slight_smile:  the geometry is displayed with the debug renderer.
