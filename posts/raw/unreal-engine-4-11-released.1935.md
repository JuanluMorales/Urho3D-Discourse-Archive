I don't really follow other engines but this seems to be some mayor news. Quite interesting what other engines are working on.
They worked a lot on character stuff like on improving skin, eyes, cloth shadowing and ground shadowing.

They also improved hair rendering but it stills looks weird: Looks more like nylon or spider web threads.

Maybe that's because there are no shadows in the hair? It also looks kinda grainy and the strands seem rather thick. Could still be improved but I guess it's getting better in general. Compared to the rest of the characters the hair looks way more unrealistic I think.

Also interesting that many, even recent, CGI movies look worse as some of the Unreal images.
