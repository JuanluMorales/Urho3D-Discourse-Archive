Iâ€™ve recently watch a link below that he can runtime compile.

Does anyone have instruction to setup this?

which turns to be:

https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/runtime-compiled-c-in-urho3d-aka-scripting-in-c/318

This is interesting. When I have a moment, I'll into this... anyway it's from 2014...

Forgot to mention the recent attempt with Cling by @godan [here](https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/use-clang-to-compile-urho/3723)

Actually, RuntimeCompiledCplusPlus is not used in the PoC I did for Urho3D a few years ago. You should be able to test RCCpp by simply compiling Urho3D with support for it (https://github.com/pamarcos/Urho3D/blob/RCCpp/RCCpp.sh). You will also need to copy the `Data` and `CoreData` folders into your `Build/bin` directory.

For RCCpp to find your Urho3D includes you need to set the URHO3D_HOME environment variable before running Urho3DPlayer:

`URHO3D_HOME=~/GameDev/Urho3D/Build/ ./Urho3DPlayer Data/RCCpp/24_Urho2DSprite/Urho2DSprite.cpp`

What do you mean with latest version? Are you using the latest commit of my RCCpp branch? That should be `b94a0a71ec8fd42fbbc6bde0d240b40801d47210`. If by latest you mean merging the latest of Urho3D into the RCCpp branch, you'd probably need to do some work in the CMake files to make it work again.

I see. Noted with Thanks
