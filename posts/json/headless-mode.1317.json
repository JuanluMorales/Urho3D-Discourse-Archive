I don’t know the internals very well, and I am curious about running the engine “headless” and streaming the resulting video to an external HW device. I am aware that there is Headless mode in Urho, which however does not run the rendering steps and no GPU-related stuff (is this correct?).\u003cbr\u003e\nCould I, theoretically, render to some memory location, get the image form there and process it as I want without displaying the window? Or is there some blocking issue why this cannot be done? I need to render roughly 2000x2000px image and stream it out the computer, only option I have now is render in window, take Camera screenshot and stream it. However having to display 2000x2000px windows is quite impractical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks for your thoughts on this\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eP.S. Thanks everybody for working on this excellent engine. Everything is so intuitive, well-modeled and easy to use.

This means that none of the graphics / rendering functionality is usable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this case, to get a working graphics context, you should open a window, but its size doesn’t matter, it can be very small like 100 x 100, and you don’t need to render into it at all. Instead you should render into a Texture2D, which can be sized as large as your GPU allows, and use the Texture2D::GetData() function to get the pixel data every frame. See the RenderToTexture example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, I’ll make no promises whether the performance will be fast enough for realtime video streaming; your usecase is outside of what I’d strictly consider “supported” by the engine.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:06:47.498Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":1,"reads":33,"readers_count":32,"score":11.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":1317,"topic_slug":"headless-mode","display_username":"Lasse Öörni","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"Urho3D Author","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":3,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":7468,"name":"","username":"Bart","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/b/f19dbf/{size}.png","created_at":"2015-08-31T14:30:32.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eLooks like a useful way to accomplish what I need.
