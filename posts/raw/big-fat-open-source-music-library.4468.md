Hi, Guys. I'm working on developing a Big Fat Open Source Music Library for game developers, youtubers, animators etc. Check out the campaign page and demo music. Show your support at Indiegogo campaign to make this a huge asset to our community if not then at least share this to help me reach wider audience. 

Have a Nice Day ahead.

I do support your idea, mentally _and_ by heart... but sorry, I'm not going to pay your tuition money.
First of all I'm not sure what open source means when the term is applied to music. I think potential backers will be interested in your licensing model. If it's not [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)([-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)), or a similar license, I - for one - cannot use it. Unfree media license makes for an unfree game... and I that would be un[LucKey](https://www.luckeyproductions.nl/). Check out the [definition of free cultural works](https://freedomdefined.org/Definition) if you want to know more.
Also, do you know the [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/) and the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/cc-by_music/)?

PS: Shuffle chose to play the song [Brad Sucks - Dropping out of School](https://soundcloud.com/bradsucks/01-brad-sucks-dropping-out-of-school) while writing this. ;P
