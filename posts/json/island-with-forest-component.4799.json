Note that I end up ignoring most of the pixels on the noisemap, as I don’t tend to have too many kinds of vegetation (so most pixel intensities are not mapped to anything), and I deliberately choose pixel intensities that are dissimilar to get a nicer distribution.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is somewhat of a simplification: I manually touch up the noise image to ensure buildings, roads etc. can’t have vegetation, and for some models, I also perform a late collision test to ensure that instances don’t overlap/intersect. I never bothered to project my buildings back onto the noisemap but that could work too.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":11,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2019-01-29T02:47:34.891Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":10,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":36,"readers_count":35,"score":27.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":4799,"topic_slug":"island-with-forest-component","display_username":"Leith Ketchell","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":2,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"suspended user","title_is_group":false,"reply_to_user":{"username":"QBkGames","name":"QB'k Games","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/qbkgames/{size}/646_2.png"},"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":1}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1098,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"user_suspended":true,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":27756,"name":"Charles","username":"zedraken","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/zedraken/{size}/328_2.png","created_at":"2019-01-29T13:15:15.695Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThanks for the description of your algorithm.
