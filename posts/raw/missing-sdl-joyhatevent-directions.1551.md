Hello, it's shown [url=https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.15/docs/html/sdljoyhatevent.html]here[/url] that SDL has SDL_HAT_RIGHTUP, SDL_HAT_RIGHTDOWN, SDL_HAT_LEFTUP and SDL_HAT_LEFTDOWN yet they are not wrapped for urho usage [url=https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/blob/master/Source/Urho3D/Input/InputEvents.h#L594]here[/url].  Am I missing something because lua is complaining that HAT_UPRIGHT is nil?  Thanks for any help.
