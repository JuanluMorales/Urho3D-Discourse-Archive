Is there a simpler way to convert DDS file to PNG/JPG other than to render to texture using Urho3D?

Hey Lumak,

If you're talking about pipeline tools. I use a free shell extension on Windows called [url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/sagethumbs/]SageThumbs[/url]. It also thumbnail previews DDS files in file explorer so it is really a handy tool. On Linux, you can just use [url=http://superuser.com/questions/159379/convert-dds-to-png-using-linux-command-line]ImageMagick[/url] and run it via terminal.

Hope that helps :slight_smile:

I was actually looking for a way to convert DDS to png/jpg or w/e in Urho3D, similar to how the Image class can save an image as png/jpg/bmp/tga files.
But I spent enough time learning the engine and creating some tools that I needed.  It's time to move on and actually start making a game, so yeah, thank you for SageThumbs.

Sounds great! I was also having trouble in dealing with previewing DDS files and had to open them one by one to check them out before. Sagethumbs is really a great find! :slight_smile:
