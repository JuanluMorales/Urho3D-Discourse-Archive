I would like to move it to Position B. But, I would like this move to happen smoothly over, say, 100 frames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo here are some thoughts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[ul]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIdeally, I would like to emulate Unity‚Äôs Coroutine architecture.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI‚Äôm familiar with the WorkQueue. However, my understanding is that it is not safe to modify scene too much from a threaded function, so while the above example might work, in general, this is not the way. And in fact, as I write this, I‚Äôm pretty sure that using a WorkItem wouldn‚Äôt help anyway‚Ä¶\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere is most likely a way to do this by implementing some behavior in the Update loop. But this is a bit ugly IMO, since you end up with a bunch of code in your Update loop that is only rarely used. For instance, you would write something like:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003eif(shouldMove)\n{\n if(!IsAtTarget())\n {\n  StepTowardsTarget(target, stepSize);\n }\n}\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this check needs to happen every frame, regardless of whether or not you want to move. Better would be to have a function that can yield control back to the main thread‚Ä¶\u003cbr\u003e\n[/ul]\u003cbr\u003e\nUnless I‚Äôm missing something (which is likely \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e) it seems that such behavior is a bit of a hassle to implement. I‚Äôve done a bit of reading on how to implement coroutines in C++, but I‚Äôm no expert, so all input is welcome. I know that Boost has a coroutine module, but, well‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not sure if I want to include Boost in my projects.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:11:44.511Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":53,"reads":11,"readers_count":10,"score":267.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":1947,"topic_slug":"lerp-over-multiple-frames","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":134,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":11572,"name":"Lasse √ñ√∂rni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2016-04-06T22:29:34.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eLike you observed, using the WorkQueue is certainly wrong for this kind of task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome things that come to mind is using ValueAnimation, or writing your own manager to which you can submit objects/attributes to be modified over time, or object methods to be called periodically.
