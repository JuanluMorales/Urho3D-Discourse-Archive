Hello, I'd like to know what everyone's workflow is for getting their animated models into the editor/engine.  Currently I'm exporting a collada from blender 2.71 and thanks to dahlia from the irc channel, I was able to see one of its animations in the editor.  I'm interested in the valve/source method of a reference model with geometry/skeleton and seperate animation files with the skeleton.  Any workflows for that type of export?  Thanks for any help.

If you're using Blender then I recommend you try Urho3D add-on at [url]https://github.com/reattiva/Urho3D-Blender[/url].

I don't know how valve/source works for animated models, but from what you describe it seems to have the same design as Urho3D.

For what it's worth, I dont use blender, the Z+up is crazy  :astonished: and the FBX support is not 100%.
I use shade 3d for unity, which is free, great FBX support, it's a bit limited (ie no UV mapping) but nothing serious, standard and pro have more features.

I use linux, but shade3d runs great in winxp Virtual Box (dual screen).
