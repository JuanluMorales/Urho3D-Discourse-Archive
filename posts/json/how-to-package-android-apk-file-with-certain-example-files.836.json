Still, if that is too much for you then read on. Currently our Android build uses a simple sample launcher activity to let user choose which samples to run in the APK. This activity is able to adapt to the number of samples available in the APK dynamically. So, all you have to do when you don’t want all the samples to be included in the final APK is, don’t build all the samples during ‘make’ step. By default ‘make’ will perform a ‘make all’. You can selectively pass the target sample name that you want to build, one by one. e.g. make 01_HelloWorld \u0026amp;\u0026amp; make 03_Sprites, etc, then follows by ant debug.
