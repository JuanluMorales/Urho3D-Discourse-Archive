Hi

How do you embed a newline or carriage return in a multiline Text so its scrollable?

The part that says experience and reputation I would like in separate line. Of course a lot more information would be added.

Btw, I haven't figured out getting the window to blend evenly on the screen. If the background is black it looks fine but anything bright it becomes weird. Is there anyway to get the focused window to be on top?
