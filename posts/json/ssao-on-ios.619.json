You’d also need to render the scene twice, do you really need SSAO for your app?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a possible idea though, can the linear depth just go into the alpha pass? You’d need to modify a whole bunch of shaders though to get it to do what you want, and the whole scene needs to be rendered to a texture first and blitted to a quad so you probably need to forgo MSAA. It would render in 1 pass though, but you may need to up the framebuffer to 16-bit per channel for enough precision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever if you do want to keep MSAA and also render in 1 pass with depth, there’s also the GL_EXT_shader_framebuffer_fetch extension which is now available from iOS6 and up AFAIK. This allows you to sample from the framebuffer directly without it needing to be a texture (a standard renderbuffer is fine) if you tap into gl_lastFragData in your GLSL shader, and most likely declare that you require this extension in the shader also.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/extensions/EXT/EXT_shader_framebuffer_fetch.txt\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttps://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/extensions/EXT/EXT_shader_framebuffer_fetch.txt\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is what I would recommend, provided depth is encoded into the alpha channel and not the depth renderbuffer directly as the spec says gl_fragDepth cannot be used, but it will take a few modifications to Urho3D to support this.
