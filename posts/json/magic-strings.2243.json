It‚Äôs a bit of a PITA, but with some patience and find \u0026amp; replace I got it properly working again. Except for one (little) thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was getting an error in the console when starting the editor: (actually, gives this twice)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003eERROR: Could not find resource UI/ScreenJoystick.xml\nERROR: Count not find inherited XML file: UI/ScreenJoystick.xml\nERROR: Could not find resource UI/ScreenJoystickSettings.xml\nERROR: Count not find inherited XML file: UI/ScreenJoystickSettings.xml\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I go looking for a reference in the Editor‚Äôs angelscript code for [color=#800040]UI/ScreenJoystick.xml[/color]. Couldn‚Äôt find one. So I do a search in the Urho C++ source. And sure enough, there is a hardcoded reference to [color=#800040]UI/ScreenJoystick.xml[/color] in Input.cpp, in AddScreenJoystick(). Well, that doesn‚Äôt seem ideal. But I wasn‚Äôt going to bother with changing it and recompiling the player, etc. So I do a search in the editor‚Äôs code for a call to AddScreenJoystick (since it is literally the only place referencing that damn joystick file). I was unable to find a single call to it. Strange. Clearly \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003esomething\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e must be calling AddScreenJoystick \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003esomewhere\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e‚Ä¶ After abusing my ctrl and f keys a bit, I grew frustrated and gave up. Fortunately those messages only presents a minor annoyance. Still felt it was worthwhile to point out these string‚Äôs existences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003eTL;DR\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-u\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003eMAGIC STRINGS\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nInput.cpp [color=#800040]‚ÄúUI/ScreenJoystick.xml‚Äù[/color] (in AddScreenJoystick(‚Ä¶))\u003cbr\u003e\nMessageBox.cpp [color=#800040]‚ÄúUI/MessageBox.xml‚Äù[/color] (in constructor)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn both cases, the method in question has a parameter XMLFile* layoutFile, and does a check. When the check fails it loads the file specified in the magic string. In both cases there is an assumption made that those directories and files will exist in a user‚Äôs Data directory, which may not be the case at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a few similar magic strings in the source for the Graphics system, but those refer to the RenderPaths / Technique folders inside the CoreData directory, the existence of which seems like a reasonable assumption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately I don‚Äôt know the best approach for removing them. If I did I would just make a pull request. Maybe something along the lines of a config file that specifies these locations, and the config file itself would be in the CoreData folder?\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:14:11.915Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":1,"reads":8,"readers_count":7,"score":6.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":2243,"topic_slug":"magic-strings","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":193,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":13603,"name":"Lasse √ñ√∂rni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2016-09-14T06:44:57.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eYou could think of those files as ‚ÄúCoreData‚Äù for the UI / Input and they could as well be moved to CoreData.
