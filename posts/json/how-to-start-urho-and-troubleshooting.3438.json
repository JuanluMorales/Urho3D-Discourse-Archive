As you know Urho3D project is cross platform, so you need to tell us which platform are you targeting. Assuming you are targeting RPI platform, the keyboard/mouse handling problem on RPI has been fixed quite a while already and it was actually a bug from upstream SDL library. The last time I booted into my RPI to check, all is good, except for a known caveat on RPI where its graphics driver has limited amount of uniforms and thus we can only make RPI supports half of number of bones compared to other platforms. So certain demos produce rendering artifact. Is that what you saw? The demos (and the assets) are not designed specifically for RPI in mind. As for the responsiveness, have you killed the X and GNOME/KDE desktop environment? We need all the computing resource to be allocated to Urho game
