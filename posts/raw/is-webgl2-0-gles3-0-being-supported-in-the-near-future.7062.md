I noticed a long time ago that there is a branch handling this stuff, but the progress seems like stucked, I wish it would came out so much since the ability of WebGL1.0 is so limited.

At this point, I think if someone wanted to dust off @orefkov 's ES3 stuff and turn it into a PR it would be welcomed. But it is unlikely to be done unless someone with a vested interest in it being completed does it. (wink wink, nudge nudge)
