This weekend next Ludum Dare game jam will take place. So if you want to test your skills, learn new things, push the boundaries of your possibilities in this incredible cutting-edge experience. Or just throw some stuff together. Well, you can just do it, and then, if there is more than one of us, we can check and rate each other's work.

Go Urho!

Try it. You'll be amazed, how much you can do in just 3 days, if you know your deadline.
