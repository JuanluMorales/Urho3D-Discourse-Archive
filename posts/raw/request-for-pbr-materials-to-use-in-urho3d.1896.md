So many of you may of noticed my work on PBR within Urho3D, and i feel its ready to be merged but i am unsure of the licence of the materials i am currently using, therefore i believe its better to remove them and use custom created materials. These materials will be used in Urho3D as example materials.

You could take textures from [url=https://github.com/The-Yak/NobiaxTexturePack]Nobiax[/url] (which use a CC0 license, basically it's public domain dedication or a very permissive license in the cases where it is not possible) then make them PBR-ready using [url=https://github.com/kmkolasinski/AwesomeBump]AwesomeBump[/url].
