Hello! I need to connect to 2 (or more) servers from one application and sync 2 (or more) separate scenes from them.[This problem is related to this question](http://discourse.urho3d.io/t/multiple-instances-of-urho3d-in-same-process/2096), Network works perfect when both server and client are working at same time. But can it be modified to work with connections to different servers? Does kNet (or RakNet) support it? Initializing separate Urho3d instances will cost too much performance.
