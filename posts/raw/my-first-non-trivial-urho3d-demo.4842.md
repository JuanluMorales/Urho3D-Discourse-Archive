Attached is a screen shot, sorry for the dual screen!
What you see, is the splash screen, which fades in and out, right before we are presented with the main menu and optionally, the gameplay.

The gamestate manager works, and I would post code, but apparently it's not ok to post code here. I am still getting my mind around that. Anyway, here's a screen shot that shows my code does work.
