Something like a windows forms Graphics.MeasureString custom algorithm would be the target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried with setting the Width and WordWrap property and then examining the NumChars, NumRows, RowHeight and RowSpacing to come up with some custom logic to find the number of characters that can be fit in the assigned width and then using the NumRows, RowHeight and RowSpacing to calculate the height requirement and truncate as required.
