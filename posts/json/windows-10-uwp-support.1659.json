To bring support to urho3D using swap chain panel, the SDL library needs to be updated to support it, OR, you have to create a seperate method for handling input from the UWP side (not difficult, most is already supported within SDL).  Other tweaks, are inside Urho3D, in Direct3D 11 pipeline, need to add support for creating a swap chain that uses SwapChainPanel (not difficult).  These modifications, will enable Urho3D to render inside a UWP application. Now, to get full support for UWP, the AngelScript library needs to enable support for W10M ARM, which it currently does not support.  I have worked with Angel on multiple occasions, but we have not been able to crack that egg to get it working yet. If you want to see the Urho3D player i created for UWP, i can package them up in a zip file, is nothing special, just a wrapper for the most part.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":13,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-07-07T16:26:06.829Z","reply_count":2,"reply_to_post_number":12,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":2,"reads":46,"readers_count":45,"score":29.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":1659,"topic_slug":"windows-10-uwp-support","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"reply_to_user":{"username":"JimSEOW","name":"","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/j/e8c25b/{size}.png"},"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":44,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":19316,"name":"","username":"JimSEOW","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/j/e8c25b/{size}.png","created_at":"2017-07-07T16:36:19.677Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/nitelordz\"\u003e@NiteLordz\u003c/a\u003e Thanks for sharing.
