But that it was not possible to create multiple windows. Done a search to see if SDL could support that and found that it would be possible to open multiple windows with a GL render context in each using the command [b]\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003eSDL_GL_MakeCurrent \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca\u003e/b\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GL_MakeCurrent\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttp://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GL_MakeCurrent\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs the version that URHO3D use support this? For creating applications with URHO, this ability would be really nice to have. But I know this is only for GL, so perhaps not supported by any other renderer… Perhaps there is something else that make that not possible… I’m just starting with URHO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also have another question about the mouse pointer, I see there are the OS mouse pointer and the UI mouse pointer. Does URHO have any commands to manipulate/check the OS mouse pointer? I just remarked that the mouse pointer position is reset to the center of the window when the URHO application is launched when I checked the demos. For a game it’s ok, but kinda strange for an application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:10:57.817Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":148,"reads":25,"readers_count":24,"score":745.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":1871,"topic_slug":"question-answered-multiple-windows-with-urho","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GL_MakeCurrent","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"SDL_GL_MakeCurrent - SDL Wiki'","clicks":1}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":171,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":10921,"name":"","username":"George","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/g/71e660/{size}.png","created_at":"2016-03-14T11:41:09.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eHi Christian\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to know the first question too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor mouse\u003cbr\u003e\nInput* input = GetSubsystem();\u003cbr\u003e\ninput-\u0026gt;SetMouseMode(MouseMode::MM_ABSOLUTE);\u003cbr\u003e\ninput-\u0026gt;SetMouseVisible(true);\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegards\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:10:58.838Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":2,"reads":24,"readers_count":23,"score":14.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":1871,"topic_slug":"question-answered-multiple-windows-with-urho","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":281,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":10923,"name":"Lasse Öörni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2016-03-14T11:52:36.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eMultiple windows in the same application aren’t supported.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":3,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:10:58.972Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":1,"reads":24,"readers_count":23,"score":9.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":1871,"topic_slug":"question-answered-multiple-windows-with-urho","display_username":"Lasse Öörni","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"Urho3D Author","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":3,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":10949,"name":"","username":"christianclavet","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/c/76d3ee/{size}.png","created_at":"2016-03-14T23:43:31.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThanks.

I’ve tried to see if I could use SDL directly (saw that the includes of multiples THIRD PARTY stuff was accessible) When the demo opened, it opened a separate windows that seem to support a openGL context!

Could perhaps even find a way to later take RTT rendering from URHO and sent it to the other SDL windows.\u003cbr\u003e\nSo a big thanks to have created a way to access the other libs that URHO uses with the includes!
