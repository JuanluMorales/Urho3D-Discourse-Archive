Who controls the irc channel? Marynate registered #urho3d on freenode [irc://irc.freenode.com/urho3d](irc://irc.freenode.com/urho3d), but she's never in the channel? I'd like have a gathering place for conversation.

A few of us have been using the channel. It would be good if more users joined, especially devs  :smiley:

Just reminding everyone, if you feel like you are being too productive, stop on by and we'll solve that.
