I wish to write a custom UIElement which draws a 2D graph, or curve (think of Blender's animation curve editor)
My first stop was the shader folder, to check if I could find a suitable shader for drawing 2D lines.
Where is our 2D version of Basic shader? I'd be happy to backport my ImGUI graph element, but I don't want to upload loads of unnecessary data to the gpu.

Do we have a basic 2D shader, which takes an ortho projection?
Or should I backport my shader as well?

Not sure if this is what you are after, but might be worth a look:
