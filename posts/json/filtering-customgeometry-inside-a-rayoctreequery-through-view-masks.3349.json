One solution that I was considering would be setting the CustomGeometry to a different view mask than StaticModels, but even by doing it the raycast still would find the CustomGeometry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, I decided to make a different test: I’ve set the camera’s view mask to different values which gave me these results:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen I set the camera’s view mask to match the CustomGeometry’s mask, the StaticModels are correctly masked out.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen I set the camera’s view mask to match the StaticModels’ mask, the CustomGeometry is NOT masked out.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen I set the camera’s view mask to any other value, the StaticModels are correctly masked out, but not the CustomGeometry.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo sum up the question: should a CustomGeometry model be set up differently so it can be correctly masked out by mask views?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance!\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-07-13T21:17:50.005Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":10,"reads":36,"readers_count":35,"score":57.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":3349,"topic_slug":"filtering-customgeometry-inside-a-rayoctreequery-through-view-masks","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":522,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":19411,"name":"Lasse Öörni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2017-07-14T09:58:59.414Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThe camera’s viewmask doesn’t affect raycasts, only the raycast query’s own viewmask does.
