As far as I see everthing (except for the camera which looks like instantiated on the “context”) all new nodes must be added to the “scene_” object. Unfortunately all samples create the entire scene in the CreateScene() function. I would like to add a bit more structure to this for my project and separate objects groups into their own classes.\u003cbr\u003e\nMy own class should have a “parent” Node* to which I add the new objects.
