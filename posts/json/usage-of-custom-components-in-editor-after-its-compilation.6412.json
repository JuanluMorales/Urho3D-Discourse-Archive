As far as I am aware, the editor does not REALLY need the class implementation, since it simply assigns component names to nodes, and allows to edit their attributes. When I was working with Source engine, they used a technique with a declaration of the class name, and its attributes in a separate text file, which the engine afterward used to supply logic for by providing backend C++ implementation. Could anybody help me out with this one? I am currently using variable editor per node in my prefabs in order to emulate this behavior, but I would really like to provide a better editor experience to modders of the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: My current solution is going to be a compilation of core game/mods into a separate library, then linking that library to UrhoPlayer and compiling it in order to provide all the necessary codebase/registrations that would be needed by the editor to use components properly.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2020-10-04T10:30:46.554Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":6,"reads":35,"readers_count":34,"score":52.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":6412,"topic_slug":"usage-of-custom-components-in-editor-after-its-compilation","display_username":"Ilya Fedorov","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":3,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":1}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1382,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":39145,"name":"魔大农 𝞍𝞎𝝳 現招蜍","username":"Modanung","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/modanung/{size}/3290_2.png","created_at":"2020-10-04T14:23:24.169Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eIf the goal is providing a better modding experience, you may want a more project-specific editor.\u003cbr\u003e\nLike those that came with the Blizzard RTS games I played.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking something that does less can be easier for both developer and user.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2020-10-04T14:28:30.967Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":34,"readers_count":33,"score":21.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":6412,"topic_slug":"usage-of-custom-components-in-editor-after-its-compilation","display_username":"魔大农 𝞍𝞎𝝳 現招蜍","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":2,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"","bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":1}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":192,"hidden":false,"trust_level":0,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"user_suspended":true,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":39146,"name":"Justin Miller","username":"jmiller","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/jmiller/{size}/2367_2.png","created_at":"2020-10-04T16:42:35.243Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/blender-2-8-exporter-with-additonal-features-e-g-urho3d-materialnodes-and-components/5240\"\u003eDertom’s Blender Exporter\u003c/a\u003e presents a nice Blender node interface to components, using a text resource (json) produced by \u003ccode\u003eUrho3D-Blender-Runtime\u003c/code\u003e and specifically \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/dertom95/urho3d-blender-runtime/blob/master/src/tools/SceneLoader/LoaderTools/ComponentExporter.cpp\"\u003eUrho3DNodeTreeExporter\u003c/a\u003e which can be adapted for custom controls.
