I am trying to make a map of all the buttons on my interface, so that I can resize them easier when resizing window on desktops. The problem I ran into with Urho3D-hashmap is that UIElement or Button-type components do not have parameterless constructor and therefore fails on build.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to read the document about containers, it only had benefits on using urhos own containers, but if I correctly understood it, the stl-containers should work on all build systems?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand my method of having to resize every single component + font based on window size might be wrong way to approach resolution independent user interface. Basically I am planning on doing something like buttons text height is 1/20 pixels of the height of the screen, and then just add the text to a button. Then go through every single ui-component and resize them based on the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù button height.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: A random side note, the default font: ‚ÄúAnonymous Pro‚Äù is invisible at font height of 36, 47, 48 and 72. I made an issue in the github about this.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:03:49.186Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":21,"reads":7,"readers_count":6,"score":106.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":887,"topic_slug":"question-urho-containers","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":205,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":5062,"name":"","username":"thebluefish","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/t/f04885/{size}.png","created_at":"2015-03-01T01:39:45.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThere‚Äôs nothing inherently wrong with using stl‚Äôs containers, but they do have some downsides. The main issue is that you don‚Äôt get to use the Reference Counter that all Urho3D objects are built on, and that can create weird issues with objects being unintentionally deleted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonestly, I wouldn‚Äôt use this approach for resolution independence. What I do, and what I did successfully with LibGDX, was to design my interface around a ‚Äútarget‚Äù resolution. Then I would calculate the scaling differences, and apply those to my object creation. In Urho3D, my approach has been to create the UI like normal, and use the setter functions to set the size. I would calculate the actual size by multiplying my target size with the scalar, and that would achieve resolution independence without deviating from the Urho3D way of managing things.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:03:49.254Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":8,"readers_count":7,"score":1.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":887,"topic_slug":"question-urho-containers","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":80,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":5069,"name":"Lasse √ñ√∂rni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2015-03-01T10:24:39.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eRegardless of whether you use STL containers or Urho containers, you should not try to contain RefCounted subclasses like UI elements as value types; they‚Äôre not meant to be copied around, so the failure you observe is intentional. The containers actually don‚Äôt participate in the reference counting in any way, so from that point it‚Äôs not important which you use.
