I think the current Urho Editor theme is a bit outdated, with that curved squares, so today I did a simple skin, following the same idea, but more flat.

I want to change UI layout too, but for now skin is enough for me. If someone want to try it, the PNG is attached below:

Thanks.

Did you also find the [SVG version](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/blob/master/SourceAssets/UI.svg) of the default UI and [template](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/blob/master/SourceAssets/UITemplate.xcf) in the SourceAssets folder?
