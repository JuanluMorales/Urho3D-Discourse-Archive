I‚Äôve found a couple other threads without much help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI‚Äôm using a point light configured as\u003cbr\u003e\ncursorLight = LightNode.CreateComponent();  cursorLight.LightType = LightType.Point;\u003cbr\u003e\ncursorLight.Color = Color.White;  cursorLight.Range = (.02f);  cursorLight.ShadowIntensity = .5f;\u003cbr\u003e\ncursorLight.Brightness = 3f;  cursorLight.CastShadows = true;  cursorLight.ShadowBias = new\u003cbr\u003e\nBiasParameters(0.00025f, 0.5f);  cursorLight.ShadowCascade = new CascadeParameters(10.0f, 50.0f, 200.0f, 0.0f, 0.8f);  cursorLight.SpecularIntensity = 2f;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI‚Äôm testing with two box primitives.\u003cbr\u003e\nvar testBox = Scene.CreateChild(); testBox.SetWorldPosition(new Vector3(0, 0, 1f));\u003cbr\u003e\ntestBox.SetScale(.04f); var testBoxModel = testBox.CreateComponent();\u003cbr\u003e\ntestBoxModel.CastShadows = true;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, I configured my renderer based on some of what I saw on GitHub and around Google results for this problem.\u003cbr\u003e\nRenderer.ShadowMapSize *= 4;\u003cbr\u003e\nRenderer.DrawShadows = true;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can see the specular highlight of the light on the boxes, so I know it the light is working. But I cannot see a shadow. I expect the smaller box in front to cast a shadow on the box behind it. The front of the box lights properly, and the sides are darker, as I‚Äôd expect. But it does not project a shadow onto the geometry behind it. I‚Äôve tried cranking the range on the light up much higher and that has no effect other than increasing the size of the specular highlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a HoloLens project. Are there known issues casting shadows using UrhoSharp in the HoloLens? I haven‚Äôt encountered a problem like that yet. Something unusual I‚Äôve noticed is that my lit textures appear illuminated from the front as if the scene has a directional light, but there are no other lights in my project. You can see in the screenshot that the front faces of the cubes appear more illuminated the other faces. Moving around the cubes etc doesn‚Äôt alter this illumination. I experimented with placing my test shadow caster on one of the sides that is less illuminated, but that had no effect on the problem. I‚Äôm at my wit‚Äôs end with this one - both the mysterious front illumination and the shadow problem. I‚Äôll be extremely grateful if anyone has an idea! I found one thread that says only directional and spot light shadows are supported on Urho Mobile - did the HoloLens inherit that limitation? That would be unusual, because it certainly has the horsepower to support that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: I just tested with a spotlight instead, and I still do not see shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can only include one image in a post as a new user, the other imgur url‚Äôs ending is E8fAG08.png.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdck-file-uploads-global.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/2X/9/95e7082c41c0e937db61dfbb28c71665944a3ee3.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2018-06-08T20:23:22.539Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":38,"reads":51,"readers_count":50,"score":200.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":4299,"topic_slug":"challenges-with-shadows-primarily-casting-shadows-on-geometry-with-a-point-light","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":3,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":917,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":24928,"name":"","username":"mustacheemperor","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/mustacheemperor/{size}/1511_2.png","created_at":"2018-06-12T14:43:58.836Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/egorbo\"\u003e@Egorbo\u003c/a\u003e could you please confirm if there are known issues with lighting and shadows in the HoloLens StereoApplication implementation for UrhoSharp?
