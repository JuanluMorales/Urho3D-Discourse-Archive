The Halo Wars guys implemented something really interesting to create more immersive environments: [gdcvault.com/play/1277/HALO- ... Terrain-of](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1277/HALO-WARS-The-Terrain-of)

They call it terrain skirts. Basically, the terrain block is duplicated on all sides. This happens in ET: Quake Wars as well and looks very good. What would be the most efficient way of doing this in Urho? Just duplicating the terrain block and changing the position?
