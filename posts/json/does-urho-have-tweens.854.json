Maybe my definition for tween isn’t same, but something with different types of interpolations, although it might be doable with animations. I think the biggest thing that I am missing from the tweens that I’ve used is something with callback functions, when for example the tween has finished. With this it is easy to chain tweens / branch tweens, although just managing the keyframes manually should do it, but the ease of using tweens probably isn’t there anymore or maybe this thing is in there already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example something I’ve used a tween for, which might be wrong way to use one, would be something where for example a level up happens after killing a monster and some level up screen comes. So chaining the tween of monster dying -\u0026gt; exp gain -\u0026gt; level up, with call backs its kind of easy, although it might not be the way tweens should be used. For example this whole sequence could be just fireing tweens in a sequence and let it go.
