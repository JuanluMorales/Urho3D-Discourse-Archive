But first I have to say thank to the people that created this great game engine. I stumbled over it when I was looking for an alternative to the Ogre3D engine, which is a little bit outdated, at least from my perspective. When I looked into the source code of the Urho3D engine I was really impressed how clean and easy to understand it is. I really do not understand why so few people are using it, but maybe I can contribute at least a little bit to change that. But now to my project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs already mentioned in the title, I am working on a component to simulate waves in real time. Similar to what Lumak already did with his FFT Waves, but I decided to use the Gerstner Waves approach. The work is based on this \u003ca href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/GPUGems/gpugems_ch01.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eGPU Gems article\u003c/a\u003e. My first version contains only the mesh transforming stuff and  \u003cstrong\u003eno texturing at all\u003c/strong\u003e. But enough of the bla, bla now. Here is a video of what is already working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"lazyYT\" data-youtube-id=\"RtDOIf-QqUE\" data-youtube-title=\"Urho3D-Ocean (Gerstner Waves) - NoTexturing\" data-width=\"480\" data-height=\"270\" data-parameters=\"feature=oembed\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it works:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI created a component called Ocean that needs a planar mesh which is used as a water plane. By applying several sine wave calculation to a\u003cbr\u003e\nthe vertices the waves are created. Currently everything is calculated on the CPU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy pressing E, the Wave Editor shows up, which allows you to change the basic properties that are used to create waves. To create some variations the basic properties are not taken as they are but are randomized. To avoid visual jumps all waves are faded-in and out. All waves have a lifetime and if a wave dies it is faded out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProperties:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eWaves\u003c/em\u003e - The amount of active waves at the same time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eLifetime\u003c/em\u003e - The time in seconds a wave is active. Randomized between half and double of the basic property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSteepness\u003c/em\u003e - Defines how steep the crest of a wave is (0 - 1). Higher values moves the vertices closer together at the\u003cbr\u003e\ntop of the wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eLength\u003c/em\u003e - The distance between the crests. It is also randomized between the half and the double of the basic value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAmplitude\u003c/em\u003e - The height of the wave. Because the length is randomized the amplitude needs to hold the same ratio to\u003cbr\u003e\nthe length as the basic properties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSpeed\u003c/em\u003e - How fast a wave moves. Can be randomized with the Speed Variation checkbox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDirection\u003c/em\u003e - Is the direction of movement (x,z). To create some variation in the direction you specify an angle that defines the allowed variation of the direction vector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFading\u003c/em\u003e - The editor allows to disable the fading but without fading you get jumps in the vertex positions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eSpeed Variation\u003c/em\u003e - Enable speed variations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSet Button\u003c/em\u003e - Feeds the properties of the Wave Editor to the Wave System. Newly created waves use the new properties. It takes some time to see the change, depending on the set lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eReset Button\u003c/em\u003e - Saves the new properties to the Wave System and erases all active waves from the Wave System to force a creation of new waves. If fading is disabled, this allows to see immediately the final state of the new properties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next steps could be something like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTry to create a realistic texturing for the water plane.

I love Urho3D and appreciate what all has been done here.  You have done a TON of GREAT WORK.  And are currently our front runner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wave generator is ‚Äúneat‚Äù (the math is cool), but the overall result in the ‚ÄúOcean‚Äù sample demo makes Urho3D look ‚Äúincapable‚Äù of a more realistic Ocean presentation.

I agree that this is a great replacement for OGRE3D.   But the samples, and momentum here are lacking ‚Äì and I think don‚Äôt give proper demonstration of Urho3D capabilities (which is part of the reason it‚Äôs falling behind, or losing momentum?).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am assuming that Urho3D is capable of producing a much better wavy-Ocean presentation.   Has \u003cem\u003eanyone\u003c/em\u003e used Urho yet for more advance outdoor environment rendering?

We want to both pick the winner, and/or help determine ‚Äúthe winner‚Äù.  We‚Äôre approaching this mostly from a C#/.NET perspective, because coding in C# is much easier than C++, while still being just as robust, with a usually-negligible performance hit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e===\u003cbr\u003e\nIronically, back in 2003, I was the one who ported OGRE3D‚Äôs Water demo to Axiom3D (the C# port of OGRE), which employed a similar Wave algorithm.  Urho‚Äôs current ‚ÄúOcean Sample‚Äù is not even as good as the OGRE3D water demo (as it had a reflection and diffraction effect).  I would assume that the current demo could be upgrade with similar effects in URHO3D with a modification to Shader techniques and settings.  (I would assume we could just apply the techniques from ‚ÄúWater‚Äù sample to the ‚ÄúOcean‚Äù sample, right?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBTW ‚Äì I‚Äôm currently using Urho3D C++ compilation for my testing.
