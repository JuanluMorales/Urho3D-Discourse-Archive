I finally got around to dealing with animating textures.  Quickly hacked together.  It seems that lua in general is gimped (stuff available on the c++ side, isn't; events not registering from c++ to lua; events not registering from lua to lua; who knows what else).

Hey,

Do you think there is a quick way to animate something like a panel?

One way is either loading a bunch of images or loading a single image and simply shifting per frame.
