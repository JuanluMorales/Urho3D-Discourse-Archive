I can not understand why is needed this pass. What exactly does he do?

EDIT:
I tried to remove <pass name="litbase" psdefines="AMBIENT" /> from Diff.xml and and nothing has changed.

Does the profit of saving one pass, when it is needed to perform various checks and sorting light sources?

EDIT: It seems that Unity uses a similar method [docs.unity3d.com/Manual/RenderTe ... ering.html](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/RenderTech-ForwardRendering.html)

[quote="Sinoid"]I don't understand what you're asking?

I assume that's does the combined pass benefit outweigh the costs associated with it in View processing? Yes, it should - other than "you go in this batch queue" and some minor tests there isn't anything notably different about litBase vs a lighting pass.[/quote]

Yes, that's what I was asking :) Sorry for my english :)
