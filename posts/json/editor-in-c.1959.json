This particular thing especially bugs me. Where Urho3D code is very clearly written and is simply easy to read and improve upon the editor code is exact opposite. It seems like a maze of functions crammed one on top of each other with bulk of manual UI management interwoven to spice it up. Urho’s UI is not exactly well suited for complex UIs as needed by editor but you guys seem to have pulled it off. However code is is less than pleasant to work with. UI system shotcomings could be easily hidden away in custom widget classes so they dont mix with other code like it is now. And then it is written in angelscript - a scripting language that takes away our tools we use (IDEs/debuggers/linters/etc) and gives no convenience in exchange. When you have to do typecasting (!!) in a scripting language then something really is amiss…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou probably noticed multiple people started writing their own editors in c++. I know at least two. \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/scorvi/Urho3DIDE\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eUrho3DIDE\u003c/a\u003e is long-abandoned sadly. There was another one written using ImGui (cant find the link now). And then its me doing same thing all over again. My reason for going that way is lack of easy integration. I want editor that is built into the game. Editor that can manage game scene next to game code operating on that scene. Sure we could plug angelscript editor into our games for this purpose but working with such system i see less than ideal due to reasons mentioned above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould it not be better to make editor in c++? Same language as engine is written in, so it seamlessly integrates into the whole package. We could do some careful thinking and allow building editor into the game so it can operate on supplied scene while by default building it as external tool. Something like libEditor and Editor executable. And with some effort code would be as clean as of engine itself lowering bar of entry for contributions in that direction. As funny as it sounds angelscript indeed makes it harder to contribute to or extend editor. The only possibly positive thing current editor has is no need for compiling before it can be run. But in reality i do not think this is really that imporant. Standalone editor is pretty small tool, building it would take negligible amount of time anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what do you people think? I myself would gladly redirect my efforts to work on official editor instead of private one.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:11:49.836Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":98,"reads":33,"readers_count":32,"score":491.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":1959,"topic_slug":"editor-in-c","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://github.com/scorvi/Urho3DIDE","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"GitHub - scorvi/Urho3DIDE: My first try of an IDE for the Urho3D Engine, WIP, help welcome","clicks":20}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":246,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":11644,"name":"","username":"PeaceSells50","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/p/bbe5ce/{size}.png","created_at":"2016-04-11T18:19:43.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eI am currently working on moving Scorvi’s work forward.
