Gitter has the possibility to integrate so called _webhooks_. This allows for changes like commits, comments and pull requests to be made visible in a chatroom's sidebar. I think it would be nice to use this feature and hook up the [urho3d/Urho3D](https://gitter.im/urho3d/Urho3D) gitter room to the *Urho3D*, *Urho3D-Components* and *urho3d.github<!---->.io* repositories so people could get live updates of what's happening and be drawn towards the activities that show up.

What do you think?
[poll type=regular results=always public=true]
* :+1: I'm in favour
* :stop_sign: Let's not
* :nail_care: I really don't care
[/poll]
...and who has the power to set this up?
@Miegamicis, do you? You seem most active from the people on [this list](https://github.com/orgs/urho3d/people).

I'm not sure that I can do it. Will have to check that tomorrow

I am personally for it - lack of transparency has been an issue for me. I'd like a transparent way to push PR and have it referenced and searchable on the forum. If it does both, then I vote with both hands.

I told you I had public repo, I did not say I keep it up to date - thats a tombstone of a state of urho :P my repo is not meant to be shared, so I don't - the public fork you see, is merely a mirror of a state of urho I based my work on
oh well ;)

If you guys want to play lack of transparency, I thought to myself, well, why publish my patches outside this forum? I was working against a wall, but my view is changing lately
