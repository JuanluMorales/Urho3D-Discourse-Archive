Does Urho has animated billboards (frames animation)?

If not is there a recommended approach other than manually updating UVs?

ParticleEmitter has support for defining UV frame animations. You may have to look at the engine code to get a good idea how they work, since there's no example resource.

Thanks, it seems like what I'm looking for so I'll try using it.
