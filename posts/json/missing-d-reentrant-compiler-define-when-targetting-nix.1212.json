Urho3D lib and its sub-libs like SDL uses pthread on Unix-like platforms. I have not observed an Urho3D app to bad-behave even though it was built without this define. When I call the “SDL-config --cflags”, its output clearly states that SDL expects this define. Yet none have reported any problems. What gives?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have time to do some research on this subject this morning and found this article that explains the potential danger of mixing supposedly multi-threading app linking with pthread but without the “_REENTRANT” define set with glibc that does. See \u003ca href=\"http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxthreads/faq.html#H\"\u003epauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxt … faq.html#H\u003c/a\u003e. It makes sense to me, which is why I even bother to search for the answer in the first place. I cannot explain why Urho3D app does not crash spectacularly on Linux/OSX though. Or is it just accident waiting to happen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeparately, I have done a quick test using GCC and Clang on my Linux box and Clang on my OSX box. When given ‘-pthread’ compiler flag, they all emit “-D_REENTRANT” compiler defines to the compiler. And I have done a quick build test using GCC on Linux, this flag also instructs linker to link against “pthread” implicitly. From what I read, it instructs linker to link against a platform-specific library for multi-threading automatically. So it is portable too although we do not really need it because we do not support other niche *nix platforms yet at the moment. It only took me awhile to reconfigure our build system to use this compiler flags. However, I would like to hear from others, especially from Lasse, on what yours/his take on this matter before pushing my changes.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:06:06.159Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":69,"reads":2,"readers_count":1,"score":345.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":1212,"topic_slug":"missing-d-reentrant-compiler-define-when-targetting-nix","display_username":"Yao Wei Tjong","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxthreads/faq.html#H","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"LinuxThreads Frequently Asked Questions","clicks":0}],"read":true,"user_title":"Admin","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":4,"hidden":false,"trust_level":4,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":6898,"name":"Lasse Öörni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2015-07-25T10:03:02.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eWe have a bastardized CMakeList for SDL which is missing a lot of platform checks for Unixes, as at the time of original SDL adoption SDL’s own CMakeList was broken.
