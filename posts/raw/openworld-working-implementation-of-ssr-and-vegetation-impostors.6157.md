I'm not sure if this is useful, but since RCKraken and I are no longer working on our project, I've decided to make the repo public. A few of the requested features are mostly working. It has working implementations of SSR and vegetation impostors, among others, so hopefully they can be useful to the community. Despite the fact that we don't engage in the community much anymore, we hope that Urho3D will continue to improve over the following years. Cheers!

Thanks for sharing this, @Don! :slightly_smiling_face:  

Btw, I see Leviathan is also [another game engine project inspired by Ogre that uses AngelScript and was started by a Finnish dude](https://github.com/hhyyrylainen/Leviathan/). Maybe he could join us? Maybe @cadaver even knows him.

EDIT: I sent Henry a mail
