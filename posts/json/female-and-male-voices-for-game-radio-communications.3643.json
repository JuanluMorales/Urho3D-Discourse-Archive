This is an amateur project and it will be available under the GPL.\u003cbr\u003e\nI would like to add more realism and for that, I started to add simulation of radio communications from a control centre to enrich the sound environment. Such messages are broadcast in English at some key point during the game session depending on the situation and for the moment, I recorded my own voice for a small set of messages.\u003cbr\u003e\nSince my native language is french, I have an awful french accent which scares me when I hear my own voice during a game session \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/frowning_face.png?v=5\" title=\":frowning_face:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":frowning_face:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe topic that introduces the game is here:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/space-simulation-preview/3620\"\u003ehttps://discourse.urho3d.io/t/space-simulation-preview/3620\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am looking for people who can record their own voice by reading a list of defined messages that I will provide (female and male English voices).

There is nothing more to earn except the fact that your voice will be embedded into a free game and that your name will be displayed in the list of contributors (if you agree of course).
