For a typical project with physics and roughly human sized entities 1=1m is a reasonable choice. This is what the PhysicsWorld uses as it‚Äôs default gravity unit - Earth gravity in m/s^2. But you could easily change that and make your whole game in feet if you wanted, or even inches, etc. As long as you keep all the values consistent you can use whatever scaling you want. Though you may run into precision issues if you go too small or too large, though I at least couldn‚Äôt tell you where that will be. My rule of thumb is trying to keep physics objects between about 0.5 and 50, and for my projects meters works well to give me that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI‚Äôm terms of relative vs absolute, you probably just need to read documentation and know a bit of physics.
