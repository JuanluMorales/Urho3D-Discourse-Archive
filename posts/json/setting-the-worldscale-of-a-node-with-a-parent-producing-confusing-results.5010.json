Node A itself is locally scaled to Vector3.One, but is scaled to that world scale by its own parent in this context. I‚Äôd like to attach Node \u003cem\u003eB\u003c/em\u003e to Node A as a child. When I set Node B as a child of Node A, its scale is modified by the parent scale, as expected. However, if I use SetWorldScale to force Node B back to its original scale, that doesn‚Äôt happen. Instead Node B is scaled to some new set of values seemingly still modified by the parent. This doesn‚Äôt seem like expected behavior, am I doing something wrong? I‚Äôve included a detailed snippet below showing the problem.
