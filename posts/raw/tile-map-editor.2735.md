Hello there!

I give up. What the hell? I install Tiled and create simple map. Try import in Urho3D editor and got crashed! Try under GNU/Linux and Windows 10.

You should use xml format instead of csv, it is set in map properties in Tiled

Or actually Urho needs an update, since the XML format is being moved away from, will be deprecated and is advised not to be used by Tiled's main developer.
