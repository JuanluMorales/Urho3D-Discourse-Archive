Hello,

I see support for Spriter which is an awesome but commercially available tool for 2D animations.
Instead I noticed a free open source alternative called DragonBones.
There is also an available C++ library which is MIT licensed.

Any future plans for this? :slight_smile:

I've implemented Demina before, Aster made some tweaks just for me on account of my complaints that greatly generalized Urho2D.

If there is a consistent format than Urho3D can support it or we can help you get it supported.

Dragon Bones Editor is closed sources and will be commercial in future, so that it is no better than Spriter or Spine.
