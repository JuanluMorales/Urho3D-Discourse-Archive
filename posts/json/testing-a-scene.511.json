Most editors have a “play” or “test” function to actually run an xml scene. So for example, if I were to set up a simple scene how would I go about actually testing it? I may have missed this somewhere in the documentation and I can’t seem to find any hits on google.

Meaning, that there usually is application logic outside the scene(s), which can be either C++ or script.

Making a complete “click play to test the game” solution necessarily dictates to the user how Urho must be used, and I suspect this would actually make Urho unattractive to some users. In this respect, it’s more comparable to a library such as Ogre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m fairly sure that Urho could be used (as a library and as the core runtime) to create an editing environment like Unity, that \u003cem\u003ewould\u003c/em\u003e dictate how it needs to be used, and as a reward it would offer similar testing workflow. Due to the reason above and also lack of manpower I don’t think it realistically can be the Urho core project’s responsiblity.

One way would be to have only the game actually interface with Urho and the editor would be a native application around it (Qt, WxWidgets etc.). In that approach the editor would need to be rewritten as a C++ application.
