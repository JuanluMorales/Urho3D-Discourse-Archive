Hi all.

I want you all to be aware of a great sample project made by the user [b]codingmonkey[/b]. It's called [b]UrhoBotTest[/b], and is located here: [github.com/MonkeyFirst/UrhoBotTest](https://github.com/MonkeyFirst/UrhoBotTest) .

I have got it to work with Urho3D version 1.5. My updates are available at: [github.com/valera-rozuvan/UrhoB ... urho3d_1_5](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/UrhoBotTest/tree/migrate_to_urho3d_1_5) .

Here is a quick video (the cool part starts at 0:52):
