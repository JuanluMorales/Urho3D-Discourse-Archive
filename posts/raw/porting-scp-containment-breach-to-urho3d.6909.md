It would be nice to have a complete open source game implementation (beside Ninja) on Urho3D for reference. Recently I discovered "SCP - Containment Breach" for a first time. It's a complete game made with Blitz3D under CC license (as it's derivative to SCP which implies CC on it's derivative work).

Game website https://www.scpcbgame.com/

The game is available for various game engines now:

Blitz3D: https://github.com/Regalis11/scpcb

Irrlicht: https://github.com/juanjp600/SCPCBIrrlicht

Unity: https://github.com/ricky-daniel13/Faithful-SCP-Unity

Would anyone be interested in making a Urho3D port of the game?
