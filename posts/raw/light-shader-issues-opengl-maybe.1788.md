Hello

Do anyone know what might cause 1:11 seconds in the video where adding a light causes the screen go bunkers?

I shown what it says in the console.

This other video works so I don't think it's the scene

Looks like broken shaders. Have you tried replacing the CoreData and Data folders with fresh copies from your copy of Urho3D?

Additionally, does this happen in just Forward, Deferred, or both?

Anything in the logs?
