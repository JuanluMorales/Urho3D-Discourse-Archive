It wasn’t complex.  We’re just doing “check alpha channel” for the pixel under the mouse cursor to determine if we have Avalonia consume the mouse event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur boolean logic looks like this, for MouseDown (or TouchDown) event:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf (Avalonia.Handled = true || Avalonia.UIPixelAlpha != 0)\u003cbr\u003e\n{\u003cbr\u003e\nAvalonia Consumes the MouseDown – and owns the other events until Mouse is released…\u003cbr\u003e\n}\u003cbr\u003e\nelse\u003cbr\u003e\n{\u003cbr\u003e\nMouseDown event gets processed by Urho Scene, as does all other events until Mouse is released…\u003cbr\u003e\n}\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is working just fine, but just isn’t as clean as it probably should be.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":9,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2021-11-18T07:23:57.318Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":8,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":23,"readers_count":22,"score":4.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":6086,"topic_slug":"non-rectangular-ui-elements","display_username":"Brian
