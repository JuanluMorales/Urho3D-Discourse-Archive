Next I defined the value animation as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003eauto *animation = new ValueAnimation( context_ );\nanimation-\u0026gt;SetKeyFrame(  0.f, Vector4( 0.f, 0.00f, 0.f, 1.f ) );\nanimation-\u0026gt;SetKeyFrame(  2.f, Vector4( 0.f, 0.25f, 0.f, 1.f ) );\nanimation-\u0026gt;SetKeyFrame(  4.f, Vector4( 0.f, 0.50f, 0.f, 1.f ) );\nanimation-\u0026gt;SetKeyFrame(  8.f, Vector4( 0.f, 0.75f, 0.f, 1.f ) );\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy understanding is then after 8 seconds, the texture will have flowed from the first 16x16 portion to the last 16x16 portion and will then loop to the first 16x16 frame portion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext I defined my material as follows and assigned the animation:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003eauto *mat = new Material( context_ );\nmat-\u0026gt;SetTechnique( 0, GetResource\u0026lt;Material\u0026gt;( \"Techniques/DiffUnlitAlpha.xml\" ) );\nmat-\u0026gt;SetTexture( TU_DIFFUSE, GetResource\u0026lt;Texture2D\u0026gt;( \"Textures/WaterFlow.png\" ) );\nmat-\u0026gt;SetVertexShaderDefines( \"DIFFMAP VERTEXCOLOR\" );\nmat-\u0026gt;SetPixelShaderDefines( \"DIFFMAP VERTEXCOLOR\" );\nmat-\u0026gt;SetScene( scene_ );\nmat-\u0026gt;SetShaderParameterAnimation( \"VOffset\", animation );\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cs\u003eIt’s my understanding that both \u003ccode\u003ecUOffset\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003ecVOffset\u003c/code\u003e are built-in animation uniforms and are applied when the VS calls \u003ccode\u003eGetTexCoord\u003c/code\u003e on the incoming UV coordinates and so there shouldn’t be any other code necessary to get this to work afaict.\u003c/s\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cs\u003eIf I don’t apply the animation, I get the first frame, first 16x16 portion of the water flow strip.  But when I apply the animation, I don’t see anything being animated nor can I make out any portion of the texture that looks like any of the 16x16 frames.\u003c/s\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo after some debugging, I found that the value for the offset needs to be provided as a Vector4 and not as a Vector2 as I originally thought.  Making that change, I now see the animations; however they are not transitioning as I would have thought.  Instead it appears it transitions as if no uvs are set, the blue water vertex color and then the texture animates in 1 pixel per frame until the original 16x16 texture is there if I were not applying any uv animations and then loops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I actually wanted here is to take my 16x64 texture, initially render the bottom part of the strip at 16x16 and then adjust the uv coordinates so that I move down the strip with each key frame until I reach the final 16x16 portion at the other end before I repeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is clearly a UV keyframe issue now but I’m not sure what I did wrong.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2021-06-14T01:34:18.715Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":14,"reads":29,"readers_count":28,"score":75.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":6894,"topic_slug":"flowing-texture-uv-animations","display_username":"Chris Cranford","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":3,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":876,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":42959,"name":"Yao Wei Tjong","username":"weitjong","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/weitjong/{size}/4_2.png","created_at":"2021-06-14T01:40:47.767Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eFrom what I recall of how this thing works, I think the mistake is you didn’t close the loop.
