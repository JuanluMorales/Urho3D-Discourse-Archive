the github version i tryed according to links in the wiki guide
but what i get is stupid cmake errors missing dll wich i do have on the searchfolder, when using codeblocks

when using visual studio 2015 on cmake configure gives simply error in configuration processs

are there not some sort of dependencies wich must be acquired? this was the case with ogre3d dependencies first, then ogre3d later

also i dont find urho3d.dll or similar in the sourceforge download

github repository is the master repository to build with, and in the docs are the official instructions for [Building Urho3D library](https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_building.html).
