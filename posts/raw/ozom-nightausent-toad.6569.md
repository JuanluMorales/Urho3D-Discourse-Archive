Humanity's most anticipated cliffhanger! I've been messing around with mocap and for some reason I kept remembering that toad working out.

Ozom is the mascot of [Dry](https://gitlab.com/luckeyproductions/dry); I've been modifying its samples, and replaced Jack, Kachujin and the mutant.
That last shot is from the latest sample 18.
