Just wondering if this would be considered the engines 1 year birthday? If so Happy Birthday, if not... *shy away in embarrassment for being wrong D:*

Welcome to the forums!

Urho is a bit older; the oldest remains of the codebase are from 2008 and it was first made available on a public SVN on 18th August 2010. However it could be said that it has enjoyed roughly 1 year (+ a couple of months) of more intense community attention while it was largely unknown before. :slight_smile:
