Sorry, I know I could help you, but apparently, it's bad form to help people here, if they are using the urho sharp fork. Maybe I can answer your question on their forum.
This forum is devoted to Urho3D public and master forks. Nothing else.

I'm just trying to keep things (relatively) on-topic and prevent this community from being suffocated through support of a dead fork. Sure, it's important to be nice, but a line must be drawn somewhere. If UrhoSharp users get better help here - and it's hard not to - I do believe these forums may be overrun. To me it seems wiser, for everyone, if UrhoSharp users were to switch to either Urho3D or [**rbfx**](https://github.com/rokups/rbfx/) instead. Support for rbfx - likewise - should not be expected *here*.

I believe the closest you'll get to something you could call _the UrhoSharp forums_ is here:
