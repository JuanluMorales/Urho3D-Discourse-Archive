Both networking and UI require most parts of a game to be somewhat set in stone. I’ve done some experiments, and what Urho provides seems to suffice for in-game purposes. However, \u003cem\u003eproperly\u003c/em\u003e testing its functionality is tricky without collaboration. \u003cspan class=\"spoiler\"\u003eSince I am only a single player.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing that seems crucial yet not included with the engine is some form of matchmaking.

In my view however, these often seem somewhat bloated and dependent on centralized services.

I really didn’t care for the \u003ccode\u003eControls\u003c/code\u003e, it was needlessly limited and didn’t bring anything for how limited it was (such as prediction or state tracking) - even for a prototype I ended up expanding that into something very very fat and then having to widdle it down before sending it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly 1 game (that is probably being played right now) I’ve made in Urho actually used networking, but it was done just before the SLikeNet move (it was the reason I did the initial RakNet work because kNet didn’t have the guts needed for LAN discovery and adding it was going to be hell) and that also used mostly remote-events but \u003ccode\u003econtrols\u003c/code\u003e were less of a problem because it was targeted onto older generic Sega-based racing hardware for the Cape-verde arcade market. So it was really a LAN game as there was a hub machine with the local router and the other machines are plugged into that.
