Has anyone tried to integrate PhysicsFS with Urho? It seems much easier to handle files the way it works, compared to the default way Urho handles data files.

I've not tried, but I'm interested to know why you think its way of handling files is easier? From what I can tell, they seem to offer the same functionality, just using different archive formats, though I think Urho doesn't limit the write directory.
