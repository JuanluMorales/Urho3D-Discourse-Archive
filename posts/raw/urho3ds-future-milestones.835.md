Hi, Urho3D team,
I notice there are 1.31 and 1.32 milestones in github. But there are no future milestones. What features are you guys planning to implement in the future, and in what time frame? Thank you for the kind reply.

We use milestones when near releases to coordinate the still pending work to release, but outside of that work is not planned ahead rigorously or in a coordinated fashion, and might change radically due to whatever gets contributed; look for development forum threads (you can also search "roadmap" for some previous discussion on this) and feature branches in github.

Some major things you can expect this year are Emscripten support and more modern render API (D3D11 at least) support.
