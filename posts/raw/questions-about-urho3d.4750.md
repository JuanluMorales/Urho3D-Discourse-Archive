Hello,

So first of all I don't know if this is the correct location, so apologies if not.

I'm doing some research what would be a good engine to make my first game. And I don't really know the possibilities with Urho3D.
I'm a beginner coder with a medium level in LUA. And I want to create an online open-world PvE game, with a MySQL database, hosting a server on a linux vps. And I'm wondering if this is possible with the engine.

Would Urho3D be a good start for my project, to make a dream like this come true?

Urho should meet all the requirements for a project like that.

Also, welcome to the forums! :confetti_ball: :slightly_smiling_face:
