One thing that bothered me alot was the lack of networking in the web builds. With that being said today I’m proud to present to you my proof-of-concept for the networking in the web builds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve tried to implement \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/HumbleNet/humblenet/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttps://github.com/HumbleNet/humblenet/\u003c/a\u003e library in the way that it was supposed to be implemented. Sadly it didn’t quite work that well and the networking was usable on half of the computers that we tested (thanks to other members in the community!). So I had to get rid of WebRTC support and do a plain server-client implementation using websockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumbleNet already has built in support for websockets, but not in the way that is needed for true server-client mode. So I did quite few hacks here and there, bunch of workarounds, bad code practices etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo with that all being said here’s the actual demo of if:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://playground-sample.frameskippers.com/\" class=\"onebox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttps://playground-sample.frameskippers.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything that you see in the game is controlled by the server, you will see the replicated state of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust open the link, press “New Game” and click on the “Flatland” image to start the sample.
