I have implemented\u003cbr\u003e\nbehavior tree, and many things I need, but I have trouble with visual representation of some things.\u003cbr\u003e\nBut not with animation/graphics per se, as that is just matter of skill, but with understanding of structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need the following game mechanics which is somewhat close to concept of “cut scene” but really not,\u003cbr\u003e\nas these should be integrated into game visually. These are transitional states from/to various\u003cbr\u003e\naspects of game. I was taking some break to have things settled, but really I still have no basic idea how to do this nicely so it integrates with game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdck-file-uploads-global.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/1X/ef2eab2a0f374a1a19aa2ba7fcf0120de1e9f342.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem is that I quickly get \u003cstrong\u003eoverwhelmed by amount of options and states required to\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003esupport the concept\u003c/strong\u003e. I need to disable character controller, get to “NPC mode” with simple BT,\u003cbr\u003e\nselect which door to walk to (how?), walk to the door, play realistic animation of openning the door (!)\u003cbr\u003e\nenter the openning (disable physics, do all preparations), then (if car) sit properly to appropriate free seat(need check) then close door.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis whole thing is extremely stateful this way which is very incompatible with current AI concepts (BTs and Utility AI). Also it is very hard to sync door openning with character animation due to lack of tools. I really want to write tools appropriate for this task, but I still could not find definition of \u003cstrong\u003eappropriate\u003c/strong\u003e. Any ideas?\u003cbr\u003e\nI’d like to see into some \u003cstrong\u003earchitecture\u003c/strong\u003e of such complex \u003cstrong\u003ebehaviors + animation logic\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently I have characters simply \u003cstrong\u003eteleported\u003c/strong\u003e into cars and buildings. That is very not cool…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso I wonder if integration of animation triggers with BTs might somehow make the problem easier to comprehend. My head is almost exploding with this. I tried to PoC this in UE4 and it was about 3 minutes to have working scene. I need to find proper workflow with Urho.

Making atomic motions and animations into behaviors makes system overcomplicated and really hard to design and debug, as when you make animations you can’t visualize the final result, so you have to do tweaking-testing loop which might take ages to complete. For example, if I need to animate 2 characters shaking hands I need to see both of them to do proper animation, If I animate just one I don’t see the result so I have to guess too many things.\u003cbr\u003e\nI did some tools for quick animation matching testing/offsetting, but that is still extremely slow process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso coding a cutscene is also very tedious process, as I do full cutscene in Blender, then I export\u003cbr\u003e\nscene via collada with animation, but this animation consists of both character skeletal animations and\u003cbr\u003e\nvalue animations for motion, with everything needed to be set up manually.
