Note that depending on the kind of modifications being done to the scene, even reading may not be safe. If objects just move, it’s generally safe to raycast into the scene in other threads. However if you’re creating and deleting objects, this involves reallocation (iterator invalidation) in various structures such as scene’s child node vector, or the octree, in which case you could have an occasional unpredictable crash. One way to mitigate this is to have phases within the frame that are guaranteed to finish first before moving to another, for example 1) object creation/destruction phase 2) threaded work phase. IMO the best solution is to have the threaded worker things operate on their own data outside the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want a large amount of units, I’d really recommend doing everything performance-critical in C++, since you have that option.

It is really not important for gameplay calculations if they are based on 1 frame old logic. So the bird following its prey in the forest would be advancing by some space, even though the prey just got eaten by the wolf, which the bird would be noticed of only next frame. Perfectly acceptable.\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, a very simplified game frame could look like this (assuming that there is separate set for gameplay and Urho data, which is a good idea anyway):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eObject creation/deletion (including callbacks to Lua scripts to notify about object deletion so that Lua scripts can remove references, like the bird losing the prey reference)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGame logic (threaded, step 3 happens before step 2 finishes), which changes gameplay data ONLY\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUrho engine loop, which changes Urho data ONLY\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWait for step 2 to finish\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eApply gameplay data to Urho data*\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*And vice versa!
