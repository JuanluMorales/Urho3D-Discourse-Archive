We need a picture or media thread sub forum in the discussion category to show off stuff.
Here's my partially working road editing.

The code is very ugly so I only show a picture :slight_smile:

Are you planning to support road generating over the terrain?

Hi Miegamicis,
Maybe not automatic road generation, but road overlay over surface.
I can't promise anything yet. But it is possible to do, by using ray cast and projecting road vertices to the terrain surface. Or just have more control points.

Best regards

This is amazing! Are you using any specific spline library?

Thanks, this is the Urho3D inbuilt spline.
Best regards
