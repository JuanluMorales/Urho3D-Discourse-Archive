Hi there, whats the best way to create a custom UIElement that works like an icon view .. example: 
 https://www.neuber.com/free/iconview/iconview.png  or  maybe explorer when showing folders in icon view: https://www.elevenforum.com/attachments/1645069384090-png.22145/  
(arbitrary examples from the web) .. so bascially the children are arranged in a grid and and it adjusts when the parents size is changed.. 

(Does it work by nesting a horizontal layout with vertical layouts?)

Thanks
