I don't know if this is against the rules, I just found it on reddit a long time ago and I didn't find it here, so I decided to put it here.

if against the rules, could any moderator remove this thread please? thanks!

the link is in the first answer, google drive (top voted)

apparently they can be used only on closed-source projects.

Don't know if this is current still, anyway.

This thread is old but new people might see it.
Mixamo doesn't require the project to be closed source. You can use the characters and animations however you want. You can't, however, provide access to the .fbx (or whatever) files by leaving them easily found in your game data. That's why the character demo doesn't supply it, but only an .mdl binary made with AssetImporter.
