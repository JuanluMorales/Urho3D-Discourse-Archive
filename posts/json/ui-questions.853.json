It uses 1080p resolution. Now the problem is that the samples have relatively small buttons when trying the samples on my phone, meaning they are almost practically unpressable. So I was trying to modify the 02 sample to use some sort of screenheight/value to make the components act as normalized size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran into a problem with line edits. I just couldn‚Äôt figure out how you could change font size for line-edit on the fly. How can I change the line-edits font after declaring the ui-components?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother question is: If I pass -s to the engine, it can become resizable, and I feel like that is basically how I would really want my application to work. I was wondering if there is a way to pass this resizable parameter to engine codewise without having to modify the engine.cpp or launching the exe-file with -s parameter? Like if I could just pass a parameter from the sample that is inheritated from application to lets say for example make resizable etc? I guess open source is good for being able to modify, but maybe there is a way already in there, which I just happened to miss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: Found my answer, when I was looking how to disable the mouse lock into the screen (which I haven‚Äôt yet found an answer), but from urhoplayer, if I inherit the Setup-function from sample, I can overwrite the engineParameters_[‚ÄúWindowResizable‚Äù] -variable to true.\u003cbr\u003e\nEdit2: GetSubsystem()-\u0026gt;SetMouseVisible(true); seems to do the trick to not lock the mouse cursor onto the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird thing:\u003cbr\u003e\nI noticed that the sample 10 has some issues with the view on my android. I think this is same as spamming decals on top of each other, they might start to compete against each other which one to draw on top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePicture of sample10 on my android phone:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/WBDOyOX.png\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttp://i.imgur.com/WBDOyOX.png\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThose lines change direction/width depending from where I am watching the screen.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:03:31.960Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":44,"reads":9,"readers_count":8,"score":221.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":853,"topic_slug":"ui-questions","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://i.imgur.com/WBDOyOX.png","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"WBDOyOX.png","clicks":2}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":205,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":4873,"name":"","username":"setzer22","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/ce7236/{size}.png","created_at":"2015-02-19T09:06:54.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eFor the line edit thing, have you tried using GetTextElement?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Text class can have its font set to it.
