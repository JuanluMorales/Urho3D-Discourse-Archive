I can feel brain cells dying trying to randomly tweak values to do what i want. Animating stuff is very verbose and done in code. Defining layouts is hard and due to tight data/layout coupling it can be quite problematic to reload UI as you would lose state. Styling without dedicated tools is also very complicated. Basically current UI system needs a lot of love to be viable and nobody is going to give that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat i personally would like to see is UI system that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhere layouts can be easily defined with a text editor alone\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHas styling independent of layout\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHas ability to switch between styles for elements\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHas predefined functionality composing animations, without a need of writing c++ code\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHas data separated from UI\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIs easily reloadable at runtime\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHas support for rendering custom graphics for certain elements\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHas support for defining resolution-independent layouts\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook i just wrote feature list of RmlUi \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/eyes.png?v=9\" title=\":eyes:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":eyes:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":13,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2020-08-24T13:33:01.313Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":2,"reads":48,"readers_count":47,"score":19.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":6338,"topic_slug":"ui-discussion","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":246,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":38778,"name":"Justin Miller","username":"jmiller","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/jmiller/{size}/2367_2.png","created_at":"2020-08-25T06:27:08.019Z","cooked":"\u003caside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Eugene\" data-post=\"2\" data-topic=\"6338\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/eugene/40/902_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003e Eugene:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought it is dead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr basically complete. \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e though there are merits to an active project.
