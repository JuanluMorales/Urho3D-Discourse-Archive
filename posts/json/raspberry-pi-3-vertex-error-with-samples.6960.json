If I recall correctly, I did that because the other prebuilt RPI cross-compiler were too old for me. I use crosstool-ng and the steps are pretty much tried and tested. I had to make a few configuration tweaked though, so there might be a tiny possibility that the SIG_BUS error was caused by bad cross-compiler. Perhaps you can try to build a simple hello world program with it and see if it runs fine or not. I must admit that I didn’t done that myself. I had wanted to test it with RPI4 at the time but it was out of stock and my order was delayed. By the time it arrived, I had already moved on to do other thing. \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=10\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":4,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2021-08-11T15:06:30.064Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":3,"quote_count":1,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":13,"readers_count":12,"score":2.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":6960,"topic_slug":"raspberry-pi-3-vertex-error-with-samples","display_username":"Yao Wei Tjong","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"Admin","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":4,"hidden":false,"trust_level":4,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false}],"stream":[43329,43340,43347,43359]},"timeline_lookup":[[1,470],[3,469]],"suggested_topics":[{"id":7067,"title":"Can the latest Urho3D version be built with VS2013?","fancy_title":"Can the latest Urho3D version be built with VS2013?","slug":"can-the-latest-urho3d-version-be-built-with-vs2013","posts_count":3,"reply_count":0,"highest_post_number":3,"image_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-25T18:00:24.336Z","last_posted_at":"2021-11-26T17:22:21.878Z","bumped":true,"bumped_at":"2021-11-26T17:22:21.878Z","archetype":"regular","unseen":false,"pinned":false,"unpinned":null,"visible":true,"closed":false,"archived":false,"bookmarked":null,"liked":null,"tags_descriptions":{},"like_count":0,"views":157,"category_id":10,"featured_link":null,"has_accepted_answer":true,"posters":[{"extras":"latest","description":"Original Poster, Most Recent Poster","user":{"id":861,"username":"GodMan","name":"","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/g/e79b87/{size}.png"}},{"extras":null,"description":"Frequent Poster, Accepted Answer","user":{"id":4,"username":"weitjong","name":"Yao Wei Tjong","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/weitjong/{size}/4_2.png"}}]},{"id":7081,"title":"Install Urho3D Library -
