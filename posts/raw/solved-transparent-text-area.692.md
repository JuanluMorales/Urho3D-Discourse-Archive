I would like to implement a transparent area to display messages in my RPG. Currently Im using a ListView:

Is there any way to get rid of the borders, but keep the scroll feature? I dont even need a visible scroll bar, with mouse wheel scrolling is enough.

Found a solution: assigned a transparent background.
