Yes I see this before. Cool tool, especially filling from brush then you move it ) and this PBR matcap is awesome
but I think it still slowly on massive models sculpting. 
Is it exists only on web gl ? Maybe somewhere exist desktop version written on something fast like C/C++ and not on java script ?

Thats great. It looks like it can handle decent amount of polys for sculpting particulary webgl is a future platform and chrome is always upgrading to fully support gpu rendering and acceleration.  :wink:

Wow! I've tried it and it perform really well here! I could do if I want a character from multiple spheres. Really impressive that all of this run in WEBGL and javascript!
