I guess, really, all xml file parameters.  I can't find a description of what they are, anywhere.  What can you put in them, and what do they mean.  That sort of thing.  I have a specific thing I'm looking for but it'd be very nice to know what all the parameters are and what is allowed as values for them, and maybe even what they do.....  Surely there is something defined, somewhere?  I love this engine, btw!  :smiley:

Hi coosadog, and welcome!

[urho3d.github.io/documentation/ ... rials.html](https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_materials.html)

The 'Related' section of the documentation contains a number of important pages, and is easily missed. :slight_smile:

Thank you so very much!  I don't know how I missed it.  That helps me.  I haven't been working with Urho3D but about 2 weeks.  The multithreading is great!  Now I'll post my next question.  How do I close this? :unamused:

Not a problem!
Usually to 'close' a thread, we just edit the first post's subject and prepend [SOLVED].
