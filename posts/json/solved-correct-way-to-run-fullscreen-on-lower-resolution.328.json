I cannot seem to make this work properly. I can see from Source/Engine/Graphics/OpenGL/OGLGraphics.cpp that SDL_CreateWindow() is invoked with the SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN flags, which should force a video mode change according to the docs, but I seem to get some weird behaviour regarding the resolution used. On Linux the app runs full screen, but the video mode is not changed - always runs at 1920x1080, which is the default desktop resolution. That might be an issue with my xorg config, but on windows the video mode is changed, but the resolution I specify does not seem to be respected - this is how the engine parameters are specified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003eengineParameters_[\"FullScreen\"]   = true;\nengineParameters_[\"Headless\"]     = false;\nengineParameters_[\"WindowWidth\"] = 1600;\nengineParameters_[\"WindowHeight\"]  = 900;\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following results in vertical letterboxing, similar to the example in the middle here:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://e2e.ti.com/resized-image.ashx/__size/550x0/__key/CommunityServer-Discussions-Components-Files/100/8737.LetterBoxing_5F00_UseCases.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems that when on full screen, then the incorrect resolution is used (looks to be 4:3 instead of 16:9 as specified).
