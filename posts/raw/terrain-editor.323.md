Hi, this is what I have on the Terrain Editor for now. It's a very early stage, so no need to report bugs, I probably know them already. But it is more or less usable and shows the idea, help and/or suggestions are welcome.

Great job, jorbuedo, congrats!  :stuck_out_tongue: 
Very promising and easy to use.
We could use mouse wheel for zoom and mouse buttons instead of spacebar, but that's personal preferences.
Many thanks for sharing.
