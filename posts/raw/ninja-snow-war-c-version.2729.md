Hi

Here the C++ version of ninja snow war if someone is interested  : [NinjaSnowWarCpp](https://github.com/fredakilla/UrhoTournament/releases/tag/FixedCpp)
I updated original code made by [scorvi](https://github.com/scorvi/Urho3DSamples) for latest urho3d version and fixed stuff that didn't work (scores, crate damage, node id...), game should works like angel script version now.

I resurrect this code because I want to use it as starting point for another game project and sample tests.
