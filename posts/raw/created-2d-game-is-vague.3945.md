I created a 2D game with urho3d, but it's vague, how can I optimize this to make him as clear as possible.![123|690x402](upload://pvAoKHrCFKyKcsSuWl4luV5utIq.jpg)

Sorry, I didn't make it clear. What I want to say is that my `StaticSprite2D` display is a little vague, and how to make it clear.

In addition, I also want to ask a question: what is the difference between the `SetOrthoSize (float orthoSize)` and the` SetZoom (float zoom)  of the camera  component`?

Your question is also very vague. But i think this is what you are looking for:

I assume you want point filtering for your textures. ![image|479x190](upload://A9laJgP16eUK2aqNIQWQtDt78cG.jpg)
