Greetings. I am just started with UrhoSharp for Xamarin.Forms, and i trying to use a custom model (.mdl, for example) in shared Xamarin.Forms project, but have not found  how to implement it; in urho samples for xamarin i found information about how to did it in native projects, or use simple geometric figures in forms project. Is there a way to import models into shared project at all, and if it is, how it can be done? Thx.

UrhoSharp's det: Switch to [**Urho.Net**](https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/urho-net-c-cross-platform-game-development-framework/6674)
