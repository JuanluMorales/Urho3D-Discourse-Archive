What I think it is truly missing is the ability to move uielements up/down. Basically lets say that you make element and set the layoutmode to vertical. Now you create several elements inside the element that has layoutmode. Then you realise that one of the elements should actually contain 2 elements, so you add another uielement, but this element gets set to last one on the list. Now to actually get this into correct position, you have to move every single element that is shown before the new element to some other node, and then back to be able to set it to last one on the list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor creating uis, the editor definitely makes things a lot easier, so I would be grateful for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething else I’ve noticed missing from the editor is the ability to hide UI-components. I was thinking that having a checkbox next to the ui-element in the hierarchy window could work. But if I’ve needed to temporarily move something out the way, I’ve been changing the position to something out of the screen, so this is workable.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:06:50.021Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":34,"reads":13,"readers_count":12,"score":172.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":1323,"topic_slug":"editor-button-to-change-uielements-order-in-hierarchy","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":205,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":7501,"name":"Yao Wei Tjong","username":"weitjong","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/weitjong/{size}/4_2.png","created_at":"2015-09-02T01:51:18.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eFor the first question.

I was looking for a button that would change the order of siblings without having to either save and manually edit xml-file or drag and drop the objects around to do the “sorting”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[quote=“Sinoid”][quote]Something else I’ve noticed missing from the editor is the ability to hide UI-components.

Does that not do what’s desired?[/quote]\u003cbr\u003e\nThe enable/disable doesn’t actually work that way in the engine. Unless you go through the whole hierarchy and disable everything, under the node/uielement, those nodes/uielements that are child to the node, will still be visible/enabled (this also includes 3d-objects/components). There is a function called setdeepenabled that doesn’t touch the remembered enable state, so it is less permanently changing the enabled states and then i can reset it with resetenabled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand UIElements do have setvisible-function that actually hides the element + all the children of the element. I am not actually sure though if I make 1000 elements, and 999 of the elements are under one UIElement, would this cause performance issues even if those 999 elements are invisible, this is something I probably should test, since I noticed that currently according to the Urhos profiling my RenderUI is actually taking 4-5 ms on 60fps, so it is spending 25% of the frame time for the UI only. It is bit hard to figure out the exact numbers of UI-rendering since the profilers UI takes some time, so unless I actually use the logging to pump some numbers out I cannot really get the correct render time for the UI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eedit: For trying to visualize the enable:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003e\u0026lt;Node 1\u0026gt;\n    \u0026lt;Node 2\u0026gt;\n         \u0026lt;AnimatedMesh\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edisabling/enabling Node 1 doesn’t affect Node 2 at all, so the Animated mesh under Node 2, that is under Node 1 will still be visible / updating animations until you actually disable Node 2.
