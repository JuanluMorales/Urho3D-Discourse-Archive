Basically it should support popular desktop and moblie platforms.\u003cbr\u003e\nI found Urho3d is the best open-source one available which has clean code structure and good cross-platform support. (Ogre3d‚Äôs code is too complex. OSG‚Äôs license is bad)\u003cbr\u003e\nThe special requirement is the app can be released as a control, so the users can use it like an android view or qt widget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter some study of Urho3d code, I found the window/input system is done by SDL. Changing SDL looks too complicated to me. I tried to removed all the SDL code(window/ogl context management) in the graphics and finally rendered an Urho sample in a QGLWidget. But the code is really ugly, and not easy to port to other platforms. So, is there a better way to do it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother question is is it possible to render multiple Urho view simultaneously?
