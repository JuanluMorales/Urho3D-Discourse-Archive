I would recommend building from the master branch on GitHub so you get the most recent fixes. Possibly there are prebuilt binaries available (you'd find them on the website if so), but it's useful to have the source available as a reference if needed.

For that, follow the directions in the documentation, and let us know if you have any problems in doing that.
