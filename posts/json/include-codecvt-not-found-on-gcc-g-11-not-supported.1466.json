The rather significant improvement is only in the area of async SQL execution which will only be available if the ODBC driver manager installed in the system supports ODBC 3.8. Since our database subsystem does not take advantage of any new features available in ODBC 3.8, there is not much incentive to upgrade to this latest release version. Having said that, I have attempted to merge the upstream changes in order to see if everything is still building. It is not, however, at least on my Linux host system. I have spotted bug(s) in their code in regards to async execution and will probably submit a PR to upstream later. Your Ubuntu probably only have ODBC driver manager that only support ODBC 3.0, so your build did not see any issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a library that builds in the lib folder the same folder of libUrho3D.
