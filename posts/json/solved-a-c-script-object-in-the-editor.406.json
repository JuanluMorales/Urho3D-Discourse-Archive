Here’s my question:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow can I make a c++ class o be shown on the editor like a regular component? (No need to have a menu entry for it, just being able to add it and modify its values on the fly is more than fine, just like script objects, but  being c++). I’m asking what should I inherit from, how should I compile it and how should I add it to the editor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think this might help other newbies lilke me and I’m willing to write a tutorial / guide / wiki page once I figure this out!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you!\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:00:12.336Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":100,"reads":15,"readers_count":14,"score":505.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":406,"topic_slug":"solved-a-c-script-object-in-the-editor","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":125,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":2196,"name":"","username":"friesencr","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/friesencr/{size}/827_2.png","created_at":"2014-08-30T19:30:52.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eUpdate:  I was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:00:12.402Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":1,"reads":14,"readers_count":13,"score":7.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":406,"topic_slug":"solved-a-c-script-object-in-the-editor","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"Core developer","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":15,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":2198,"name":"Lasse Öörni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2014-08-30T23:45:04.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eYour class needs to be a subclass of Component.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook at something like the C++ VehicleDemo sample, where it registers the Vehicle component (factory + attributes).

Additional C++ components require them to be linked to the executable, but there’s no way for the Urho library/engine, or an unmodified Urho3DPlayer to know of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypical way to solve this would be to load plugins as dynamic libraries. The plugins would have some kind of constructor / initialization function, which registers any subsystems or classes contained within. However, there’s no plugin system in Urho (at least so far), instead the assumption is that a C++ application uses it like a library, and from that follows that it’s the C++ application’s responsibility to register any classes or functionality outside of Urho’s builtin ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEDIT: note it’s also just as valid to “fork” Urho3D and add your own classes directly to it. This fits particularly well if you need to do other engine customization at the same time.
