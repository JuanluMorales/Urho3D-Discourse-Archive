0. Remain respectful of other members at all times.

0. Use tag [SOLVED] if you find an answer, post it in your thread, it will help others.

0. Use DropBox, Imageshack, imgur.com or similar in order to host big files / attachments.

0. Use [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/urho3d/urho3d/issues) for bug reports. If you are unsure if it's a bug, or have a question of how something works or whether something is supported, post here in the forum.

## General Posting Guidelines

1. USE SEARCH FIRST!
There is a pretty good chance that unless you have some really odd or unique problem that it has been addressed on this forum before.
Use the forum’s search feature first to see if there are already some good threads on the subject. It’s easy to search – just click the “Search” button at the top right of the page.

0. Be DESCRIPTIVE and use common sense when naming your topic.

0. Post a descriptive topic name! Give a short summary of your problem IN THE SUBJECT. Don’t use attention getting subjects. They don’t get attention. They repel attention and annoy people.
Be patient, help people out by posting good descriptions of what you need help with, and not snapping at people if you don't get a reply immediately, or did not get the reply you wanted.

## Misc

1. Signature
Signatures and avatar images are subject to the forum rules as well. Use common sense. Animating images should not be obnoxiously attention drawing or distracting (e.g. using a full-image black and white flashing) to not detract from following the discussion.
Maximum height of image: 64 px.
