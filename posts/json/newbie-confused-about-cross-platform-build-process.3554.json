I’ve read “building urho3d library”, “using urho3d library”, and \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/wiki/Setting-up-a-Project-(CMake)\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eSetting up a Project (CMake)\u003c/a\u003e several times and this is my understanding of the process:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDownload Urho3D source, this is the universal package for any platform\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRun one of the .bat, .sh, or cmake-gui to create a platform- and IDE-specific “build tree”\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOpen VS solution/use make/etc to build engine from the build tree\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCreate own project, use same scripts but specify URHO3D_HOME to use built engine\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom my understanding of this, my C++ files would be too far “downstream” to be moved to a different platform easily, since they’re in a project that is attached to a platform-specific build. First of all, is that a correct assessment? If so, I feel like a possible solution would be to edit the CMake files of the original Urho source to include my files, so whenever I use CMake to generate a build tree for whatever platform, my files are already in there. However, I don’t know if this is the actual “correct” solution, and if it is I don’t know enough CMake to know how to do that. Another way that might work would be to manually move my code between pre-built build trees; it seems messy but I’ll do it if that’s what I gotta do. \u003cstrong\u003eIdeally I’d like to have one folder I can move around onto any platform and have the CMake scripts generate the files I need for whatever build system, just like the source does now but with my project included.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome minor questions that are less important than my main one and can be ignored: I am also confused about the necessity of “project scaffolding” as described in “using Urho3D library”. It seems like CMake already generates all the folders for you - why would you need to create them yourself? Also, what is the difference between Urho3D and Urho3D SDK? Is the term SDK used to mean one of the pre-built things you can download instead of the source?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks for reading, I know I’m a little stupid (I think I confused myself even more in writing this post) and more than likely am missing something obvious, but I’ve been stuck reading those 3 guides for the past 2 days and I can’t wrap my head around it.

The project scaffolding prepares a project “source tree”, which you should then populate it with portable C++ code. The CMake invocation (via CLI or GUI) generates the project “build tree” for a specific target platform from this source tree. When cross-compiling ensures the cross-compiler toolchain is in the PATH of the host environment. The generated build tree can then be used to build the binaries for a specific platform. Multiple build tree can be generated from a single source tree. Use separate build tree path, naturally.
