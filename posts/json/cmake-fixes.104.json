CMake “External Project” concept. It makes your project as the central of thing and put Urho3D project (not just the Urho3D library) as external. I understand that it could download/build/install the external project automatically for you so that you only need to focus on your own project. I would like to see that being supported by Urho3D project as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it stands today, our existing build scripts are still centered around Urho3D project. Using Urho3D library as an external library is pretty much an after thought. Having said that, in our own way we do support using this use case as documented in \u003ca href=\"http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/a00004.html\"\u003eurho3d.github.io/documentation/a00004.html\u003c/a\u003e. The drawback with our current approach is, it still put Urho3D project in the center, it needs to be ‘pulled’ and build separately before building the dependent project. On the other hand, it does provide a ‘feature’ that is not possible using the “External Project” approach. In our unorthodox way, we could let dependent project refers to Urho3D library in its project root tree. i.e. it does not require Urho3D library to be installed first in the local filesystem. Imagine the scenario where one could have different version of Urho3D project root trees (one tracking remote master, a few from previous release tags, or one that merged with someone’s own changes, etc); the dependent project have the option to use any one of these Urho3D library by simply changing the URHO3D_HOME environment variable, without needing to overwrite the Urho3D installation in their filesystem. So, I would like to see we add new “External Project” support into our build scripts without losing our current ‘feature’ for no reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, as it stands today, our existing build scripts are friendlier to command line interface than to GUI tools. It is apparent that building of Urho3D using cmake-gui is not even mentioned officially in our documentation. You are welcome to make any changes that would make cmake-gui becomes officially supported and hence building Urho3D using cmake-gui can be properly documented. There is one important thing, however, that I would like to point out. We are just recently completed our change to instruct CMake to configure an “out-of-source” build tree. So, naturally, we would think twice (at least for me) to accept changes that would bring us back to a non “out-of-source” build again. There are a few reasons why an out-of-source build is better. In short, you have to convince us on why we need a new CMakeLists.txt in the project root but outside of “Source” directory.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":5,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T00:58:02.350Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":4,"readers_count":3,"score":0.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":104,"topic_slug":"cmake-fixes","display_username":"Yao Wei Tjong","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/a00004.html","internal":false,"reflection":false,"clicks":0}],"read":true,"user_title":"Admin","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":4,"hidden":false,"trust_level":4,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":485,"name":"","username":"OvermindDL1","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/o/a8b319/{size}.png","created_at":"2014-02-20T20:16:54.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eActually you could keep the current way too, just need a root CMakeLists.txt that can build out of source by default.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMostly I like to do it this way so I can link to a specific git tag so I do not need to worry about what my jenkins build server has or I have or whatever else.
