It already has great refactoring support and after coding in Java/Scala for a long time that is something I miss a lot in VisualStudio Express.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment Clions uses cmake to create a project, there is no other way yet. You have to create a CMakeLists.txt with all necessary info in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set up a very simple test and it does compile, but when linking starts I get loads of ‘undefined references’ to Urho3D.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried this first with a Urho3D-build from Visual Studio and thought this might have to do with Clion using mingW64-g++ (btw: is that idea correct?). So I build Urho3D with mingW64, but nothing changed. (and also I got a libUrho3D.a which won’t work on Windows, right?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s totally possible that I make a stupid mistake somewhere or it could be a problem with the IDE.
