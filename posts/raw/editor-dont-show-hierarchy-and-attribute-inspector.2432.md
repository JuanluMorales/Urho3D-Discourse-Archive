Hi Ibrahim, and welcome to the forums. :slight_smile:

A bit of a problem, eh?

F1 should show the console, maybe some error? That's also logged in something like %APPDATA%\urho3d\logs\Editor.as.log

[b]* edit*[/b]: You might also move or delete urho3d\Editor\Config.xml and see if that helps.

It may help to know what version of Urho, like git master or latest stable. I didn't think Urho used the Windows Registry but I could be mistaken.
