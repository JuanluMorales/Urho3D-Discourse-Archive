Hello, everyone, I'm a newbie on 3D game development. I plan to make a 3d game for practice now, but I don't know where to find the 3d resources such as 3d animated characters, scene models etc...

Do you have any great websites to seek what I need? Thanks!

You can also find 3d models and resources from other opensource game engines/tools and make the conversion if it is a common 3d format (fbx, dae, obj), like you said if it's just for practice or just make sure to check its licensing if you eventually decide to use it. (usually CC-BY-SA like opengameart).

Their license requires encrypting or using proprietary format to protect the models.
Urho uses open formats and no encryption, so there's extra work to comply with it.

I just made a feature request to allow reading package files from memory so you can decrypt them first, if they're encrypted:
