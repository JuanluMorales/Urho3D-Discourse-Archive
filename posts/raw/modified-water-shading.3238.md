Just thought I'd post some modifications to the water shader/example that I've been working on.

Before:

After:

If you have any suggestions for improving it, let me know. I've been trying to get the water just right.

Oooooh, that looks _really_ nice.

Thanks! I plan on changing the normal map texture at some point to get better specular highlights.

Very nice looking color. 
I have a request for underwater shader as well.

I really like that result! The specular highlights are done really well, I'll need to take a peek at the code for that.
