Need someone who have time and tolerance to explain about implementation of so-so realistic adjustable slipless walk using Makehuman model, Blender and Urho3D, to ignorant person lacking systemic knowledge.
As time is not free I will try to compensate the trouble (but for me it is hobby activity, so I might
not afford you. Or we could barter for some things).
