Does anyone have any idea on the conversion tools and process to use an HDRI like these: http://hdri-skies.com/

You're looking for *latlong to cubemap* (or some other combination of those terms).

If you need to also filter those cubemaps you can do it all in one go through cmft: https://github.com/dariomanesku/cmft/issues/25
