Hi guys,
Have you tried any good open source tools for animation retargeting and more specificly something that works nice with motion capture and custom rigs ?
This one looks pretty cool but there aren't much of a code on how to be implemented: [chrishecker.com/Real-time_motion ... rphologies](http://chrishecker.com/Real-time_motion_retargeting_to_highly_varied_user-created_morphologies)

Doing retargeting at engine level seems... wrong. You should use your favorite DCC to retarget stuff. It will give you more freedom to fix errors.

Ikinema can do it at game engine level. It makes sense if the characters are procedural.

Thanks for the question and reply. Even I got to know about it :slight_smile:

Blender should be good but with the many armature that comes with most addons, it is a quite a challenge to find a definitive process. I suggest trying the pro tools if you have access to it or some form of trial.
