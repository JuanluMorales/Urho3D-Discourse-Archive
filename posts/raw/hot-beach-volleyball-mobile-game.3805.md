Hi All.
I started developing a mobile game for android and I want to share the results already achieved.
Game - Beach volleyball.
This is the current stage:

This is the screencast of the current alpha version of the game.

There is work on the playing according to the rules. While the bots simply beat the ball back with the addition of a random change to the speed of the ball. Worked the order of the serves, the presence of the goal, the change of the court, counting scores.
The game is up to 5 points with a matchball. After the victorious dance, a new party begins.
Video sometimes slows down due to the recording of the video itself. When the recording is not conducted, the FPS is stable 55-60.
Device Yotaphone 2 (2014 year, Qualcomm Snapdragon 800, Adreno 330, 2GB RAM), FullHD.
Just now you can not control characters, only pause game and move camera by joystick in pause state.

Who wants - can [download apk](http://horovo-games.tk/files/bv-release.apk).
Models was created in Makehuman and Blender, animations are standard from mixamo.
In the future I plan to make mocap with kinnect for animation.

To raise funds for the game, I started a campaign on [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/beach-volleyball-game-sport)
Please, if possible, share links to the campaign, so that as many people can learn about the upcoming game.
