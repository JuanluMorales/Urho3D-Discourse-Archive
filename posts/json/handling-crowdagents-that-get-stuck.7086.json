For example if I jump down a ledge the agents have a path leading up to the ledge and the ground below it. However if I have multiple agents that stand by the ledge that I jumped off of. One of the agents sometimes falls to the ground below. This agent will not move anymore even though he is on the navigation mesh still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust seeking some suggestions on a solution. Maybe re-spawning agents that are stuck?
