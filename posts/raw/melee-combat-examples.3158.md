I've seen this amazing video of a game made with Urho with melee combat:

And i ended up with a lot of questions:

* Is collision being detected using stand capsule colliders? Or is there some bone logic going on here?
* What about damage? Is it being calculated depending on where the colliders hit and velocity?

Normally games requiring an accurate fighting scheme uses specialized character whose bodies are very detailed and everything is separated into what you need.
So expect capsules all over the body and so on... an example I know can be a character made with Miku Miku dance...
