In my package is an `XMLFile` of a node with a `ScriptInstance` component (and others). The file attribute of the instance is pointed correctly, with the path appended to point to the package. When I add the package, get the xml file, and load it, it finds everything except for the angelscript file, where it searches in `Data/`, completely ignoring my package.

I just fixed it by restarting the editor!
