My experience with Urho is still pretty poor, and I decided, that participating in a jam is a good opportunity to learn. I went with script only, because I’m not familiar with C++. It also was my first game jam. I worked in CodeLite with AngelScript autocompletion set up with help of this thread: \u003ca href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/urho3d/8WOOGAdwlEU\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003egroups.google.com/forum/#!topic … WOOGAdwlEU\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDownload: \u003ca href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8845134/ld32/supapowah.zip\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8845134/ld32/supapowah.zip\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSource, single .as file: \u003ca href=\"http://pastebin.com/4fL39qaC\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttp://pastebin.com/4fL39qaC\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nLD page: \u003ca href=\"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-32/?action=preview\u0026amp;uid=51412\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttp://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-32/?action=preview\u0026amp;uid=51412\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeel free to criticize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really enjoyed working on Urho. It performs like a beast. And I figured out a lot of new things in that three days despite the lack of documentation and tutorials for noobs like me. Anyway, here are several things, that I want to clarify:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater in development the Urho3d player started to crash pretty often. There is no particular action, causing it. It should be something in my code, but is there a way to debug a Urho3d player crush (other than building and running it in debug mode)? Is it dumping crash logs somewhere?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs there a way to restart the whole game?

There is no reason (Though Game Jams sometimes require you to forsake all reason) to require someone to run GAME.bat.
