We’d like a 2nd instance of Urho UI to place inside the View3D, and have it work the same as it does for the full screen now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps I’m missing something; another/better way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now – we have a work-around which is to simply use the SAME Urho.UI.Root to create the Sprite (which renders Avalonia), and place that Sprite overtop the View3D window, so that it appears to be a part of the View3D.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis seems to work fine, and performs well-enough - but the solution feels kludgy.   I think we’d prefer to have a separate UI.Root that runs inside the View3D itself.   (A UI inside the UI.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother idea that just popped into my head now is that maybe we can Parent the Game UI sprite to the View3D – and maybe that resolves it, if there is relative-sizing/positioning – so that if View3D resizes or moves – the child Sprite inside it will move/resize in unison.   (OR… we can just manually do this math, and create the same effect in C#).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere’s a screenshot of our KLUDGE – the UI sample we’re using here is crap – it’s just a placeholder.   We have already figured out how to make this semi-transparent with click-through-to-scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/2X/7/74b10ce575f1b69fe43be4abcb07605d74a1d27c.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/gEiIlr1fbKLRsfx3FlBFt2J89u4.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/optimized/2X/7/74b10ce575f1b69fe43be4abcb07605d74a1d27c_2_690x366.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"gEiIlr1fbKLRsfx3FlBFt2J89u4\" width=\"690\" height=\"366\" srcset=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/optimized/2X/7/74b10ce575f1b69fe43be4abcb07605d74a1d27c_2_690x366.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/optimized/2X/7/74b10ce575f1b69fe43be4abcb07605d74a1d27c_2_1035x549.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/optimized/2X/7/74b10ce575f1b69fe43be4abcb07605d74a1d27c_2_1380x732.jpeg 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/optimized/2X/7/74b10ce575f1b69fe43be4abcb07605d74a1d27c_2_10x10.png\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"meta\"\u003e\n\u003csvg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\u003e\u003cuse href=\"#far-image\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cspan class=\"filename\"\u003eimage\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"informations\"\u003e1920×1020 106 KB\u003c/span\u003e\u003csvg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\u003e\u003cuse href=\"#discourse-expand\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2021-12-20T08:58:17.550Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":18,"reads":25,"readers_count":24,"score":95.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":7105,"topic_slug":"multiple-application-ui-roots","display_username":"Brian Knox","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://Urho.NET","internal":false,"reflection":false,"clicks":3},{"url":"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/2X/7/74b10ce575f1b69fe43be4abcb07605d74a1d27c.jpeg","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"74b10ce575f1b69fe43be4abcb07605d74a1d27c.jpeg","clicks":0}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1334,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":44025,"name":"SirNate0","username":"SirNate0","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/9f8e36/{size}.png","created_at":"2021-12-21T16:28:20.004Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eI’ve not tried it myself, but what happens if you just create another UI?
