Hey!

I just built urho and it seemed to go fine, got all the files in the right place and everything after ALL_BUILD and INSTALL. But when i try to use it in a VS project, i get lots of undefined type errors ( Urho3D::URHO3D_API) and syntax errors. Im including Urho3d and have libraries set up correctly. 

PS, when's 1.33 gonna release ? :stuck_out_tongue:

EDIT:
I forgot to include Urho3d.h as well and now it worked. Silly me :frowning:
