A ResourceRouter could be tied to a specific URL type and ‚Äúres‚Äù, ‚Äúusr‚Äù/‚Äúuser‚Äù, and ‚Äúapp‚Äù would all be default ResourceRouters provided out-of-the-box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstandably this is a bit of work. So before I go about implementing this, I wanted to get other‚Äôs opinions on this idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe purpose of this is to allow greater flexibility. Plug-n-play ResourceRouters would allow people to share their own schemes. Additionally it allows us the benefit of storing file locations in scripts and data. Currently a file path in the editor can only point to a resource, it‚Äôs not easy to point to a game save location or a path for logs without building the path in C++ or in a script.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:07:43.868Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":65,"reads":20,"readers_count":19,"score":329.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":1440,"topic_slug":"resource-path-urls","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/resource-type-loading-from-url-programatic-resources/4601/4","internal":true,"reflection":true,"title":"Resource type loading from url (programatic resources)","clicks":0}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":80,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":8254,"name":"Lasse √ñ√∂rni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2015-10-22T07:31:31.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eIf you want to go all-out with this, you would tie it directly to Files, meaning you could open a File directly with a ‚Äúusr://‚Äù path. However, this would be a large rework, and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs justified. On the other hand, the ResourceCache‚Äôs current file-related purpose is to offer access to read-only files for reading resource data, so if the URL rework would make it also hand out writable files for e.g. configs and savegames, we‚Äôd somewhat dilute that purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you imperatively build the paths using GetUserDocumentsDir() etc. you are 100% sure what‚Äôs going on.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:07:44.237Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":20,"readers_count":19,"score":4.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":1440,"topic_slug":"resource-path-urls","display_username":"Lasse √ñ√∂rni","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"Urho3D Author","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":3,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":8285,"name":"","username":"thebluefish","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/t/f04885/{size}.png","created_at":"2015-10-23T16:35:07.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eWhat about adding a ResourceRouter to FileSystem? Then File could do a route based on a FileSystem-wide ResourceRouter. That would also allow people to use the same ResourceRouter class for both FileSystem and ResourceCache if they‚Äôd want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don‚Äôt think that having writable resources in ResourceCache would be appropriate. So this is the next best idea IMO. I did a quick‚Äôn‚Äôdirty addition of a ResourceRouter to FileSystem, then made File route through it. It seems to work OK, if not a little confusing due to the naming. My main concern is how ResourceCache interacts with File, setting two ResourceRouters could have some odd issues if someone doesn‚Äôt realize that it would be processed twice.

I would like to have some sane way of being able to define a path and know where it‚Äôs going to go. It‚Äôs just part of some of my gripes with trying to flesh out data-driven development with the engine. I don‚Äôt want to expect a user to build a path in C++ or scripting every time they want to access a file. Instead they should be able to just take a path, and be able to know where that file is going to be.
