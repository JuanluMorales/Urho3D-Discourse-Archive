Hey man I Installed your demo but it hangs. When I start the game there is black screen for 10 seconds then a car drops from the sky the timer resets to 0 and then nothing, can't move can't do anything. Also the performance look very bad when the car drops.

What type device you test on? Did you see the Play menu when the car dropped on the ground?
Can you tell me your phone's screen resolution?

ps: In some devices, the car's shadow will drop the game's fps.
