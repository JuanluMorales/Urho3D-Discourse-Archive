I want to take the DragUI sample's buttons and throw them on top of the RibbonTrailDemo sample.

What is the fastest way to achieve this by recycling both sample's code?

Do I remove the window handle inside the DragUI's constructor, and then create a new object inside the RibbonTrailDemo class?

Or am I supposed to create a new main.cpp class that initializes both samples in one file?
 
I would appreciate any code, I am sure I am just overlooking something fundamentally simple, thanks.
