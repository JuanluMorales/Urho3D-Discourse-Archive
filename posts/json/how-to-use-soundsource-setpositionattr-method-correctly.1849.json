With your approach you would have to set the position back at a very precise time moment to not hear any kind of click-sound. There may be still a distortion due to sound buffers even if you hit the exact moment. When creating a new sound you can just use the normal hardware accelerated (is it?) sound looping.\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso you may want to fade in and out at your cut so that there is no abrupt change in the waveform, which is hearable as a click-sound. You would do that fading out by changing the sound data. The fading can be pretty short and is usually not noticeable directly (unless the music change fells weird rhythm and melody wise), but a jump due to not fading is really noticeable.\u003cbr\u003e\nI‚Äôm note really a sound or sound buffer expert though.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:10:41.801Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":2,"reads":46,"readers_count":45,"score":19.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":1849,"topic_slug":"how-to-use-soundsource-setpositionattr-method-correctly","display_username":"gawag AKA damu","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":206,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":10689,"name":"Lasse √ñ√∂rni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2016-03-08T08:38:57.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eSetPositionAttr() is an internal method used for serialization, but I suppose you can use it.
