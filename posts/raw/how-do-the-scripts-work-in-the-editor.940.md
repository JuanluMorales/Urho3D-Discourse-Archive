Hello, I am trying to add scripts to my project but I fail to work.
What I do is:
1) create a node.
2) add a box to the node.
3) add a scriptinstance to the node (Rotator.as)

but the node dont rotate when i played the scene.
someone help me?

In addition you will need to specify the class name for the ScriptInstance within Rotator.as . It's currently not like in Unity where the class name is assumed to be the file name.
