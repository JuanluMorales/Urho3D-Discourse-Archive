hi,
I have released a new game with urho.

Nicely done!

Noticed that on my Samsung Galaxy S2, the game shows an ad after 2 plays, but doesn't return from it and remains in a black screen instead. I didn't let it connect to a Google+ account if that makes any difference.

I tested it on my nexus4. Everything is ok. Maybe I need to test it on more
devices including sumsung phones. 

Thank you very much!

Same thing on my Tab3. The ranking scene also does not work, I think it is because like Lasse, I also opted not to login when prompted.
