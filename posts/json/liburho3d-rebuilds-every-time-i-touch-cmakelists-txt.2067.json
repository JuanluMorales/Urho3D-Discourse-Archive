Without the symlink/mklink, our build system would fallback to hard copying of the header files from source tree to build tree (whenever they are not identical) EACH time CMake rerun itself and as part of the post-build process of the relevant libraries when they get built. This would not only slow down your build unnecessarily but also is susceptible to problem you described. When wrongly configured, the build system could actually fallback to use directory copying without file comparison check. If that happens then the header’s timestamp got changed and a rebuild is ensured (each time make checks it will see itself needs to be rebuilt). In fact we have had one such report in our issue tracker recently and the problem has been fixed in the master branch. Having said that, as our code keeps changing and we have more than one devs contributing the changes, the same problem may reoccur again. The only way to get a way from this potential problem is not to use this fallback approach by setting up mklink privilege correctly on your Windows host system (symlink can be taken for granted on all *nix).\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:12:46.791Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":7,"readers_count":6,"score":1.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":2067,"topic_slug":"liburho3d-rebuilds-every-time-i-touch-cmakelists-txt","display_username":"Yao Wei Tjong","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"Admin","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":4,"hidden":false,"trust_level":4,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":12442,"name":"","username":"TheComet","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/thecomet/{size}/1493_2.png","created_at":"2016-06-09T06:25:57.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eAh, I forgot to mention I’m on a linux host. 4.4.6-gentoo x86_64.

On one hand it is how CMake works when custom compiler flags per compilation unit is being used, so it is CMake/Makefile generator limitation. On the other hand, it is us who told CMake we need custom flags. When there is a new source files or deletion, the number of compilation units changes. This alone does not cause problem as the modified CMakefiles does not cause a rebuild in itself. However when the list of compilation units has custom compiler flags then the “flags.make” file is forced to be modified and that file alone is being referenced by all the compilation rules in the Makefile. So when it changes, all the rules get triggered. I will see whether we can do away with custom compiler flags.
