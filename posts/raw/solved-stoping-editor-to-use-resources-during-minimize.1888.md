Having a stop completely button for editor is a good option, for example when I minimize the Editor, it still using My CPU and GPU, that would be nice to have a stop-when-minimize button or something.

In current master branch, the editor now pauses the engine on minimize. Also defocused FPS is reduced to 10. Reducing it further would cause bad responsiveness when minimizing / restoring, so that's why it's not set as low as e.g. 1 FPS.
