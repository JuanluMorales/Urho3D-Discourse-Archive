I think we should move Zoom to Ctrl+Scroll or some other keypress, and move translation back/forth back to the scroll wheel. It's more intuitive this way, and that's how Maya, Blender, etc do it.

Just a thought.

If you have any thoughts on how to make it consistent for orthographic views that would be helpful.  The reason why it was done this way was to make the experience constant across orthographic and perspective.

Well, since ortho is a toggle, why not toggle zoom on scroll with it?

I am going to wrap this in an option.  It might take me a few days to get to it.

Took me while to get to this.  Sorry.  I am still stuck in math hell.  Math really eats my goat.  Besides my goat there is now an option in the settings \m/

Thanks,
