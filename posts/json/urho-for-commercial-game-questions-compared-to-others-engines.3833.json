This means, I can create any game with it. For me, Ogre and Urho looks good for it.

I mean overall usage of engine, not in displaying nice graphics.\u003cbr\u003e\nI have interest in Unreal Engine, CryEngine, both are free, because there is lot of done, like nice editor. Big down are system requirements. I dont know if I can create more low level graphic game running in old hardware, but with Urho (I played with samples and run smoothly) or Ogre I am sure I can. Another area is programing. With Ogre or Urho, it looks like you have everything under control, on UE or CE, I am not sure.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mention Ogre, mainly because Urho is inspired with this rendering engine. But Ogre have advantage that there are some commercial games created with it.
