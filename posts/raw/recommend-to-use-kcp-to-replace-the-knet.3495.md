kcp is a very good udp protocol.

Is it better than e.g. RakNet?

I thought the problem with RakNet was that it was discontinued.

That's my stand of information as well. Basing anything on discontinued projects does not strike me as a very good idea as it basically means having to maintain it yourself in case of required changes.

Was this library discussed already? It seems to be a continued fork of RakNet:

Very interesting! A well-maintained fork of a library that was already used here would of course be optimal (least required changes/learning curve, I figure).
