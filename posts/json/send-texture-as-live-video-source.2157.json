I want to be able to plug in an HDMI or DVI cable and have ONLY the texture video come through as a live feed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, normally if I plugged in a HDMI cable and connected it to, say, a projector, the whole desktop screen would come through. How can I stream just the texture part? How can I say: \"only this video/texture/frame buffer should be output through the hdmi cable? Tricky right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would not be surprised if it’s not possible. In fact, my plan B is to create a little webpage/js script that reloads the texture on disk every time I write it. Then, via localhost or whatever, someone else can see it. No cords necessary. HOWEVER, it would be “nicer” if I could do the HDMI/DVI thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny thoughts?\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:13:32.286Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":5,"reads":8,"readers_count":7,"score":26.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":2157,"topic_slug":"send-texture-as-live-video-source","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":134,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":13081,"name":"hd_","username":"hdunderscore","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/hdunderscore/{size}/1151_2.png","created_at":"2016-08-06T04:38:39.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eNormally when you plug in a hdmi cable, the new screen can be set up as a separate desktop ?

I guess the thing is, for this particular project, we would be connecting to another computer (in this  case, the computer running a bunch of projectors via D3 - \u003ca href=\"http://www.d3technologies.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ed3technologies.com\u003c/a\u003e). As it turns out, D3 knows about HDMI cables and registers itself as an external monitor with the laptop (or so I’m told).
