Back on the old google group, I remember someone discussing integration with a video playback library. Any news on that front?

Indeed, but I think this thread would still better fit in the "Feature Request" section since nothing on this seems to have been developed yet.
Otherwise, this might probably be part of the 2D implementation project from aster2013.
