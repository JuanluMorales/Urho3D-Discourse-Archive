What is a good parameter or set of parameters to check to see if a camera is dirty within a certain threshold.  I want to want to have a certain tolerance so that the camera can be moved/rotated/zoomed etc. slightly without a trigger.  Is checking all the parameters individually the most elegant solution?

Thanks,
Chris
