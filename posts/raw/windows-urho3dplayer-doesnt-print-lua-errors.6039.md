Hi, i have created an issue report at the Github repo https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/2613

It explains i nmore detail there however the problem is that running the urho3dplayer given in the OS X binary, my script prints errors to the console, but when i run the same script on the windows urho3dplayer, no errors show in the console?

The error is as follows:

    function onCallback()
        undefinedValue:PerformFunction() -- should print "ERROR: Execute Lua function failed: Attempt to index nil value 'undefinedValue'
    end

-------------------------
