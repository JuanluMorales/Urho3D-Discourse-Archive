The initial result (\u003ca href=\"https://scan.coverity.com/projects/4954\"\u003escan.coverity.com/projects/4954\u003c/a\u003e) shows our defect density is a little bit higher than other open source projects having similar code size to ours. The defects have not been categorized yet but 832 of 1252 are actually defects from third party libs, so actually our code base quality is not that bad. It can be better of course. Coverity provides a nice web interface to track the defects which encourage team work to categorize and take action on the defects together.
