Hi,

I made a little addon for the Editor : a node multiplicator. 
This is usefull to clone a nodes with an offset transformation.
It may be enhenced with new options like clone into child or into the parent scene, global/local transform, etc.. but basics are here.

all code is in angelscript in this branch on my repo;

If any interest I could make a PR.

Nice!
I'm inclined to suggest a different name for the tool though. Something like _Array generator_, _Duplicator_ or _Create clones_?

Yes, I was not clearly inspired by a name. I renamed it Duplicator ;)
