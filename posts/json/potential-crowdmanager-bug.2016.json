My suspicion is that you already have a crowd manager in place, and when you create a new one, that new one stays empty because everything is already added to the existing one.

When I was having the issue, I created the Octree, Camera, Lights, and DynamicNavigationMesh. I then built the NavMesh with nothing in it. Then, I added the CrowdManager. When a player joined and it was time to actually build the world. I add a plane and some boxes, and then rebuilt the NavMesh. However, I don’t touch the CrowdManager again. Then, the player’s units are created, include a CrowdAgent component.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first setup, the CrowdManager was initialized with an empty NavMesh, which resulted in none of the CrowdAgents being controllable, or even recognized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I (purely out of frustration) removed the line creating the CrowdManager component in the root scene node when the scene is first created, the game actually worked as expected. Through the VS debugger, I found out that my first call to CreateComponent when the connected player’s ships are created actually creates a CrowdManager for the scene if one does not already exist. The CrowdManager was then initialized after the NavMesh was populated, however without my explicit knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving the creation of the CrowdManager component to  after
