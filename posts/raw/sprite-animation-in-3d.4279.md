Hi, LOVE the engine, thanks very much for keeping it alive, I've wished I could help.

Is there a good way to display sprite animations in 3D? Also how can I get the current camera? EEErrrn and, is it possible to normal map it?

obs: I have frames separated in files, since they are a quite big.
Thanks, Maluco.
