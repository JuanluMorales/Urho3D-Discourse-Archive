I just started working on creating an editor to make graphical and other effects for the game that I'm working on. Basically all of the FX that would go into attack animations. So particle effects, ribbon trails, and adding simple models with animated materials to make effects similar to what you can [see in games like Super Smash Bros](https://www.google.com/search?q=super+smash+bros+impact+effect&tbm=isch&hl=en&chips=q:super+smash+bros+impact+effect,online_chips:visual+effects).

So far I'm mainly working on getting the editor working for Materials and Textures, but I thought I'd share my progress since I got it working with Material's ShaderParameterAnimation this morning.

Note: The FPS is actually reasonable, I just lowered it to shrink the *.gif file size.

Looks like a great tool to tweak those animations into perfection!
