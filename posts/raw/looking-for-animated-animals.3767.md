I wonder if anyone have animated animal models?
Style and polycount doesn't matter. I need it for my experiments with animation.
There is Mixamo for biped creatures, but other cases remain uncovered.

I sometimes am looking for the same use case. Still didn't tried, but I happen to found st. here in Blender that's in theory easy to port...
