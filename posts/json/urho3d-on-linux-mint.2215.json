The page that you are reading and editing exactly have this problem. The prerequisite packages listed in the page is evidently adapted from an older Urho3D “Building prerequisites” documentation page. That list is now expanded somewhat in release 1.6 after we have successfully integrated SDL CMake scripts into our own build system. The new prerequisite package list for Linux can be seen here \u003ca href=\"https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.6/_building.html\"\u003eurho3d.github.io/documentation/ … lding.html\u003c/a\u003e. Most notably is you may want to use PulseAudio instead of ALSA for sound server. This list is by no mean complete. It has intentionally left out those packages that are essential for any general 3D software development works, such as the native compiling toolchains (user has a choice between GCC and Clang) or OpenGL API implementation (user has a choice between open and proprietary one). That is, we only list what is specific to Urho.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for building with URHO3D_DATABASE_ODBC enabled, I am afraid I was not able to reproduce your problem. I have both UnixODBC and iODBC installed but the build system still correctly configured my build tree to link against “\u003ca href=\"http://libodbc.so\"\u003elibodbc.so\u003c/a\u003e” and not the “\u003ca href=\"http://libiodbc.so\"\u003elibiodbc.so\u003c/a\u003e”. This is because our script gives higher precedence to UnixODBC. For what it worth, I am using Fedora 24. Those build scripts are mainly developed using Fedora but CI tested using Ubuntu, however, none of our CI jobs are setup to build with URHO3D_DATABASE_ODBC build option enabled at the moment. If you can reproduce your problem in a clean new build tree then you may log it as an issue in our issue tracker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have totally no idea how you could get “-linux-gnu” in your linking phase.
