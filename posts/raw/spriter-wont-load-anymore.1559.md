Hi i'm was programming a platformer on Urho3D 1.4 everything was working fine. Now i've updated to Urho3D 1.5 and now it won't load shows a message "ERROR: Could not allocate area" and return null. the imp loads just fine. It need's a better error output, what image are failing to allocate. EDIT: After messing with Urho3D code i've found what image gives error.. but there's wrong with it.
