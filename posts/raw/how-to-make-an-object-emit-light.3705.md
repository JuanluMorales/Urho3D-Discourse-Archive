Hi I'm still new to Urho and I've not found anything that would help me make an object emit light

![lYhOW|333x500](upload://dVudiEtTpxDibq98DNqaJEfDG0i.jpg)

I'm trying to go for this type of effect.

If anyone can help me that would be great.

Emission material + Light source component inside the object.

Getting that nice AO will be hard, though.
