My first problem is I can’t parse Urho headers so the “Find declarations for…” function isn’t working, and of course the code completion for Urho classes aren’t too. I tried to set in the project options/ C++ parser option the path of Urho’s include directory (/home/user/Urho3D/include), but nothing changed.\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso I wanted to store the sources in an ‘src’ folder, but then the project won’t build… Do I need to store them all in the same directory where the code::blocks project exists? - of course its not really important, because I can use virtual folders to see them clear in the projects, but I think its good to know if I can somehow \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks, and sorry for dumb question, but I never used Code::Blocks before, and also rarely used Linux yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: Almost forgot some infos: I used the Urho’s cmake_codeblocks.sh file, and maybe good to know I wasn’t succeed with the URHO3D_HOME, so cmake didn’t find URHO home, I had to browse it by hand. Also the projects builds fine when I have my sources in the project root
