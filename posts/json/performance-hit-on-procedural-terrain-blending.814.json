I’ve implemented the ability to script certain filters that can modify the heightmap or the blend texture, including filters to randomly locate terrain blending based on noise fractals, filters to place roads etc… But I have noticed that the more I use filters that modify the blend map, the worse my performance degrades. For example, when I first start the application, I get decent performance: \u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/XFJi03P.jpg\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003escreenshot\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I run a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/JTippetts/U3DTerrainEditor/blob/master/Bin/TerrainEditFilters/dirtgrass.lua\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003efractal filter\u003c/a\u003e that iterates the blend image and sets the pixels of the blend, then calls \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003eblendtex:SetData(blend)\u003c/span\u003e to upload the edited texture, the framerate drops noticeably: \u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/EoXEHwY.jpg\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003escreenshot\u003c/a\u003e. Doing further operations such as building an elevation map and adding a road drop it even further: \u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/9XJOUDy.jpg\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003escreenshot\u003c/a\u003e. (Note that the heightmap, while it has a miniscule effect, is nowhere near as drastic as modifying the blend map.) If I quicksave the heightmap and blendmap, exit the application and restart, then load the quicksaves, I get a lot of performance back: \u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/6E4E6H0.jpg\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003escreenshot\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I’m wondering if I’m handling the process of modifying and updating the blend texture sub-optimally. My standard technique is to modify the texture, or part of a texture, directly into the image then upload the image via Texture2D::SetData(). But I wonder if I somehow miss a crucial step, perhaps related to detail levels or to discarding old texture data or something of that nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePossibly related, when I create the texture for the blend map I initially call SetSize(0,0,0,TEXTURE_DYNAMIC) in order to specify dynamic usage, as I did not see anywhere to specify the usage otherwise. However, according to the comments, using sizes of 0 causes the texture size to follow the application window size. Then, when SetData is called, the texture is resized again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am using a 64-bit Mingw-w64 build with LuaJIT and Direct3D.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:03:05.663Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":20,"reads":6,"readers_count":5,"score":101.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":814,"topic_slug":"performance-hit-on-procedural-terrain-blending","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://i.imgur.com/XFJi03P.jpg","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"XFJi03P.jpg","clicks":3},{"url":"https://github.com/JTippetts/U3DTerrainEditor/blob/master/Bin/TerrainEditFilters/dirtgrass.lua","internal":false,"reflection":false,"clicks":1},{"url":"http://i.imgur.com/6E4E6H0.jpg","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"6E4E6H0.jpg","clicks":0},{"url":"http://i.imgur.com/EoXEHwY.jpg","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"EoXEHwY.jpg","clicks":0},{"url":"http://i.imgur.com/9XJOUDy.jpg","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"9XJOUDy.jpg","clicks":0},{"url":"http://discourse.urho3d.io/t/u3d-terrain-editor/765","internal":true,"reflection":false,"title":"U3D Terrain Editor","clicks":0}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":30,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":4466,"name":"Lasse Öörni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2015-02-01T15:57:34.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eLooking at the profiling blocks it doesn’t seem like anything in Urho’s native view update \u0026amp; rendering is slowing down, but there’s something outside it that is taking a huge chunk of time.

However, after you pointed out that it doesn’t seem to be in the render code, I started to dig deeper.

This minimal example makes me believe that it does, in fact, lie in how Lua generates and collects garbage, specifically user data such as Color. The newly-added call to collectgarbage() should execute a full GC cycle, but has zero effect on the issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor clarification, the slowdown is not a temporary condition. It doesn’t go slow for a few seconds or minutes until some internal state has caught up; it slows down for the entire further duration of the program. ie, it never catches up. When the degradation is extreme (such as after I execute a terrain filter followed by a road filter, or if I do numerous executions of the minimal example) the application becomes quite nearly unusable, with very exaggerated input delay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, when I execute the above minimal example, the execution time is about 4 seconds, after which the frame count drops from 100 to 17 and stays there. However, if I remove the line that interpolates colors, then the execution time becomes nearly instantaneous, and no permanent slowdown is observed after execution.

I created a filter script that all it does is loop 1000000 times and create a local Color() value. Using collectgarbage(“count”) to display used memory, I get a used mem count of 2437 before the loop and 27692 after the loop. However, calling collectgarbage() for a full gc cycle then displaying the used mem count again I get 22434, meaning that a whole lot of those locals that were created inside the loop are not being garbage collected. Continuous reporting of used memory shows that the used memory is never freed up, regardless of garbage collection. This results in an ever increasing amount of garbage that never gets taken out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis test triggered a little bit of a memory for me. I haven’t worked on my game project in many months, but I remembered having performance issues with it and having a general unwillingness to try to deal with it helped me to stop working on it. So I went back and did some memory tracking, and it looks like I am getting gradually accumulating garbage there that never gets collected either. Not in chunks as large as a loop iterating on a 1024x1024 image generates, but over time it adds up. I think this gc problem might be the root cause of the slowdown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve spent quite a few hours googling for potential leaks and problems with tolua++, but I don’t really find much outside of some old unanswered posts on various forums and one discussion back in 2001 regarding earlier versions of Lua and tolua being unable to collect userdata objects returned by value, but nothing recent.
