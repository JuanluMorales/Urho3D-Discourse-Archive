Hello,

I'm playing around with Urho2D and I can't find a way to deal with multiple RenderPaths.
I want to use for example AutoExposure but not on the entire scene, I don't want the character to be affected by the post processing.

Let's say I have:
node1 with StaticSprite2D on Layer -1
node2 with StaticSprite2D on Layer 0
node3 with StaticSprite2D on Layer 1

What I want is to apply a different RenderPath to these 3 nodes.

What's the best way to deal with this?

Can you make a simple example?
