Hello guys, does anyone know good documentation on vk mask? 
I have found  [this one](https://vk.com/pages?oid=-157574223&p=Руководство ) but it's not complete. It uses urho3d engine but methods are different.

To be more specific my task is to cut a face from the camera and set it as a texture for billboard.

I didn't quite get what role Urho plays there, does VK uses Urho3d engine inside its official mobile application?

Just read further, it seems that this community uses Urho3d offline and converts it into compatible one via some sort of chat-bot.

It is implemented on top of official app (social network)
