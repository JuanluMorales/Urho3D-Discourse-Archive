I work with Cadaver on realXtend and other stuff on my day job here in Finland. Personally very exited about tundra-urho3d and the potential it has.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[quote=“gunnar.kriik”]OK, I see. So I take it you are going without Qt for the Urho3D implementation. Anyhow, neat to see how the project evolves. Is it somewhat similar to Second Life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWRT offscreen rendering - I’ve been playing with the Chromium Embedded Framework lately. It’s pretty neat - you can render Chromium / Blink into an offscreen buffer and upload it as a texture to the GPU. Currently in the progress of starting a demo using Urho3D. What CEF does differently from Qt is that it does rendering and scripting in separate processes, so the “main” process is mosly unaffected by that, however I have not done any benchmarking on using it as an overlay over heavy 3D scenes yet. It is however a very simple way to create 2D views, as you can use most of the latest HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript as you would for regular webpages. Pretty cool, but it is a HUGE third party dependency. HUGE.[/quote]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI assume you are using CEF3 if you have separate rendering etc. process. I’ve implemented a CEF1 based renderer myself for Meshmoon Rocket (a realXtend Tundra based client/server distro we work on at Meshmoon). We are working with the current tech with Qt and Ogre. The initial problem was that QtWebkit was crashing our main app as it was running in the same thread. CEF (basically the Chrome browser) is pretty stable but I didn’t want to make that mistake again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I made a little process that our client starts up per rendered web page. They talk together via simple binary TPC protocol I cooked up. They share a common memory block so that both processes can read and write to it, for stuff like this Qt is pretty helpful framework. Easy to use API and good documentation, I used QSharedMemory for the mem and Qt networking stuff for the TCP client and server (and writing the binary messages). You can do stuff like resize, load url and route  full set of mouse and keyboard events to the process. In return the CEF process sends over rects that have been updated in the shared memory region texture and the main process updates the region to the Ogre texture. The result is live rendering a web page onto any submesh in the world and you can interact with mouse/keyboard in 3D. You can run youtube videos and all that stuff with good framerate. As a bonus of course this spends very little CPU in the Tundra processes main loop. CEFs rendering is nice as you hardly ever do full rect copies but a bunch of little ones where actual changes happened. QtWebkit it might have been possible to dig this info, probably if overloading the paint events or embedding into QGraphicsScene, but we didnt even try as 4.8.x QtWebKit is slow and buggy anyway :I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m in the process on porting this thing to CEF3 so we would get a bit more up to date chrome and get the multi process architecture. Currently a bit stuck porting the keyboard code as the API has changed quite a bit. Rendering and loading pages already work with minimal porting effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs said Qt is great for generic programming in a GUI app, but it has some pretty bad overhead too in certain places. It’s not very suited for game engines at all, but your run of the mill GUi apps I would pick it any day of the week. Unfortunately we were too deep into embedding Qt everywhere once this was realized, and the fact that it made some non perf critical parts very easy to program, that there was no going back without a ~full rewrite of the Tundra core. Luckily the funding game through and we got Cadaver working on it now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eP.S.

Yes - I have been experimenting with CEF3, as there has been quite a bit of changes there lately, such as they switched to Aura instead of GTK on Linux (windows had that already), and CEF3 now uses the new software compositor code path to render offscreen ( \u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/issues/detail?id=1257\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\u003ecode.google.com/p/chromiumembed … il?id=1257\u003c/a\u003e ).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rendering and scripting is done in separate processes, so the “main” thread (game thread) is not held back - or crashed if the rendering or scripting goes bad. However, there is the issue of transferring the pixel buffer to GPU on the main thread, which may or may not be noticable (I am currently unsure of how the buffer is transferred from the rendering process to the main process, and how many memcpy-s are involved here). Probably not many, but needs investigating. They have an issue in the tracker for sharing a GL/D3D texture/surface between the processes, but this is still in the works ( \u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/issues/detail?id=1006\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\u003ecode.google.com/p/chromiumembed … il?id=1006\u003c/a\u003e ).
