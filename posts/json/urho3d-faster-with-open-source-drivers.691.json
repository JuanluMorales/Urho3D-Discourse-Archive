I wanted to see if I actually had some improvement, so I tested 14.9 with Unigine Heaven, then modified my Urho game to display FPS. Then I tested my program with mesa drivers after uninstalling Catalyst 14.9, and last, tested 14.12 Omega with Heaven and my Urho app. The result was quite similar with both Catalyst drivers, confirming that Omega is not an essential update at all. The surprising result was that my Urho3d project reached up to 200 FPS with mesa, but no more than 194 FPS with 14.9 and 198 with 14.12.\u003cbr\u003e\nIm really curious about this and Im even thinking about implementing a dedicated benchmark mode and scene in my game for future tests.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:02:09.750Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":9,"reads":2,"readers_count":1,"score":45.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":691,"topic_slug":"urho3d-faster-with-open-source-drivers","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":76,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":3749,"name":"","username":"alexrass","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/alexrass/{size}/1036_2.png","created_at":"2014-12-25T12:46:11.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eMy experiment on Half-Life 2:\u003cbr\u003e\nopensource driver \u0026gt; 80 fps\u003cbr\u003e\nproprietary driver 20-40 fps\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:02:10.211Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":2,"readers_count":1,"score":0.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":691,"topic_slug":"urho3d-faster-with-open-source-drivers","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":36,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":3805,"name":"","username":"boberfly","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/b/aeb1de/{size}.png","created_at":"2014-12-29T02:29:40.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eWhich GPU are you using?

Long ago I built Urho3D like this but just running the WineD3D GL wrapper not Gallium-nine over the Nvidia proprietary driver and it worked perfectly, but I didn’t really look at the performance, it was more or less to see if I could do it and keep development in Linux while making Windows builds at the same time.
