I have a MinGW-W64 installed in my Win7 VM and I can confirm the “d3dcompiler.h” can be found in one of the “include” sub-dir shipped with the distribution. The question is still whether our CMake build scripts has configured the Makefile to look for the “d3dcompiler.h” there. Are you using MinGW-W64?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso you may want to know that our CMake build scripts (in v1.31 and even current HEAD) do not attempt to find Direct3D SDK for non-MSVC compiler on Windows. So, unless you have manually altered the CMake build scripts I doubt that your generated Makefile is currently using the June 2010 SDK. You can double check that by searching for “DIRECT3D_INCLUDE_DIRS” variable in the Build/CMakeCache.txt. If you want to use the SDK then you have to modify the script to call “find_package (Direct3D)”.
