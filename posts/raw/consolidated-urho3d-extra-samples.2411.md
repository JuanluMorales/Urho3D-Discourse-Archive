I've consolidated my Urho3D project samples into a single repo: [url]https://github.com/Lumak/Urho3D-Extra-Samples[/url]

Others will probably get deleted in the future.

Excellent! Would you recommend / would it be OK to link these from the Urho documentation? (external links section)

@cadaver
Sure, no problem.

@cadaver, curiosity is getting better of me.  Was there a particular sample that you liked? I'm guessing it's geom replicator.

I haven't tried running them yet, from the screenshots all look equally interesting.
