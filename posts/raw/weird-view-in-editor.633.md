Sometimes I get this weird problem in the editor, could be after using mouse whell, or simply when using free look.

I have to close the editor or double click some far node in the hierarchy to move away to go back to normal view.

In Editor settings, are you using 'Mouse wheel camera position' or not?

If the camera gets distorted, there is a reset camera option at the bottom left of the editor (blue button near where the yellow text is).

No, it is not enabled.

Yeah, then in that case mouse wheel changes the field of view, which can cause this kind of view warping. I prefer to enable that option so my field of view doesn't change.
