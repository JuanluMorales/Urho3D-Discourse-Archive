Actually, I just do not know how to realize my skill system(in RPG-like games).\u003cbr\u003e\nUnlike the inventory system, each skill is a class (which derives from LogicComponent) rather an object. So I need a container to store my character’s skills. This container cannot be defined as something like ‘Vector\u0026lt;Skill*\u0026gt;’ as it should contain a bunch of classes rather than objects. So how can I just store a bunch of classes in a structure ?\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I really want to ask is that how do you guys(No offense.
