I did a simple diffuse color .XML file and it would flicker between that and the default color. Some of the faces of the torus (flat shaded) would be the correct color and others not. Rotation in game would flicker this. Sometimes I’d get it jumping between random colors. I have a color palette method I use with UVs and trying that did the same thing. The only thing that fixed it was adding a more primitive mesh along with the object in blender. So, it was a torus and cube as one object. Then everything worked as expected. The solution is kind of dumb but I just hid a tiny cube inside the torus. Just wondering if anyone else ran into this? Why would this happen? Godot didn’t do this. Is Urho assuming something about the normals of the torus? I tried recalculation and different UV unwrapping. But in the end none of that worked nor is necessary if a cube is within the same object.
