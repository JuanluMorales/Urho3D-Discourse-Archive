I am not familiar enough with the engine source code… Have paid close attention to the Directx11 and OpenGL3.1 additions that have been in progress lately and I am do know how Urho3D supports graphics systems (it unsurprisingly is similar in some ways to a lot of other solutions out there)… A LOT of work had to be done to add Directx11 support because of how different it is compared to Directx9 and OpenGL 2.1.  OpenGL 3.1 wasn’t too bad if I understand correctly because of how similar it is to OpenGL 2.1.  But GameCube graphics, etc. would be a big challenge.  Not really because 3D is hard to use on those but because the 3D graphics API’s are REALLY different from Directx9 (the graphics model that Urho3D is centered around).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, the more different the graphics API is from Directx9 and OpenGL 2.1 the harder it will be to add support.  I do not see the devs making support for any non-standard graphics API’s any time soon because of the work involved (and the lack of popular demand).

But I don’t think the official Urho development should have anything to do with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHmmm… I agree Urho3D should not regress…  if you want to make the port darkhog maybe the two Urho3D branches could be combined by disabling some features that are not compatible with old consoles.  But IDK, this might not even be possible without considerable effort at best. :\\\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEDIT: on the note about that Urho3D doesn’t have developers… While the pool is relatively small right now I think it will only grow.  Take irrlicht for example.  Their last release was a year and a half ago.  They only support DirectX9, OpenGL2.1, and some software renderers…  Plus, they don’t even have an official mobile port.  There is coppercube but that isn’t under an open licence and isn’t geared towards c++ devs.  Irrlicht doesn’t support any gaming libraries.  I think devs that are sick of irrlicht will come here just as I did. \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=10\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":9,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:04:34.431Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":1,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":5,"readers_count":4,"score":1.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":970,"topic_slug":"dreamcast-support","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":197,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":7001,"name":"","username":"Siana","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/ed655f/{size}.png","created_at":"2015-08-03T06:13:26.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eHello there,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMyself a random person myself who is fairly well familiar with Dreamcast and am looking for something curious to port onto it. Currently porting a 2D game (but a pretty elaborate one, originally Direct3D-rendered) that i will announce later and elsewhere - one of the biggest tasks is crunching down 80MB worth of memory allocation per level down to perhaps 1/10th of it, just goes to say, if you have the technical foundation ported, doesn’t mean it will be useful for existing software on such a limited platform. Came here through google.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not familiar with Urho3D, but i disagree with Cadaver in principle. I believe a shader-friendly abstraction is advantageous even for fixed function hardware. The abstraction should merely not enforce shader language nor shader semantics. Then a description language can be defined, akin to Quake3 shader language \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e that will merely trigger and combine backend’s rendering features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs far as higher level parts depend on specifics of shader language, and given Urho’s feature set, that looks like a shit ton of work, perhaps not within my capabilities as far as time goes. I’d like to ask the OP, Darkhog, though, what the purpose of this exercise of porting an engine is? Are YOU specifically an application developer, a user of the engine? Can a limited subset of the engine features be encircled that you need so volunteer X doesn’t need to work his or her ass of for something nobody will ever use? If you are not, then who is this for? If this doesn’t result in a released software that people can run and will enjoy, then it’s a wasted effort.

The trouble with adapting this to Urho3D is that Urho has deliberately chosen the graphics abstraction to be at the low level, assuming support for actual GPU shader programs in some shader language that can be compiled with different compilation defines. The low (API specific) level knows nothing of things like lights or even camera view / projection matrices, it just binds shaders and feeds them with uniform data from the higher level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the current abstraction, you could make a fixed-function backend only by seriously ugly hacks, basically by watching for shader names, compilation defines and
