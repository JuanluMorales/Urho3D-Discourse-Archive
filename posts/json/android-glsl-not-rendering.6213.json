I only want Position and TEXCOORD1, no normals (unlike the built in plane.mdl).    So it’s 5 floats per vertex (Vec3 for Position, plus Vec2 for UV coordinate).   I am using an Index Buffer, with 6 indices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll works wonderfully on Windows, for HLSL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when I switch to Android with GLSL, it fails miserably.   My Vertex/Pixel Shaders for GLSL seem fine because they are butt simple and work just fine when applied to the Plane.Mdl.    However when I use my own manually generated Plane Geometry, it is NOT VISIBLE on Android.  No Errors, No Warnings in the log.  The Plane is simply just NOT THERE.   I’ve pared the GLSL vertex shader down to merely rendering RED, instead of even reading a DIFFUSE map…  still shows NOTHING.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI then simplified my Geometry to be Position-Only (no TEXCOORD), and still is shows NOTHING.  Other shaders work fine on Android, and so does the Plane if I use the Plane.MDL, but just not my manual geometry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eHere is the shader:\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"hashtag\"\u003e#include\u003c/span\u003e “Uniforms.glsl”\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"hashtag\"\u003e#include\u003c/span\u003e “Samplers.glsl”\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"hashtag\"\u003e#include\u003c/span\u003e “Transform.glsl”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evoid VS()\u003cbr\u003e\n{\u003cbr\u003e\nmat4 modelMatrix = iModelMatrix;\u003cbr\u003e\nvec3 worldPos = GetWorldPos(modelMatrix);\u003cbr\u003e\ngl_Position = GetClipPos(worldPos);\u003cbr\u003e\n}\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evoid PS()\u003cbr\u003e\n{\u003cbr\u003e\ngl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0);\u003cbr\u003e\n}\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e===\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eand here is the code that sets up the Plane Geometry setup:\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eprivate const int NUMVERTICES = 4;\nprivate const int NUMINDICES = 6;\n\nstatic private short[] _tileIndexData = new short[6] { 0, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2 }; // { 0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 3 };\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003es_TileVertexData = new float[] {  -0.5f, 0, -0.5f,    0.5f, 0, -0.5f,     0.5f, 0, 0.5f,   -0.5f, 0, 0.5f  };\n\n_tileIndexBuffer = new IndexBuffer(UrhoApp.Context);\n_tileIndexBuffer.SetSize(NUMINDICES, false, false);\n_tileIndexBuffer.SetData(_tileIndexData);\n_tileBounds = new BoundingBox(-0.5f, 0.5f);\n\nVertexBuffer vb = new VertexBuffer(UrhoApp.Context);\nvb.SetSize(NUMVERTICES, ElementMask.Position); \nvb.SetData(s_TileVertexData);\n\nGeometry g = new Geometry();\ng.SetVertexBuffer(0, vb);\ng.IndexBuffer = _tileIndexBuffer;\ng.SetDrawRange(PrimitiveType.TriangleList, 0, NUMINDICES, false);\n\nvar model = new Model();\nmodel.NumGeometries = 1;\nmodel.SetGeometry(0, 0, g);\nmodel.BoundingBox = _tileBounds;\n\n_plane.Model = model;\n\n_material = _tileMaterial.Clone();\n_material.CullMode = CullMode.None;\n_plane.SetMaterial(_material);\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e===\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain – all this works fine on Windows, but is NOT VISIBLE on Android and log shows no warnings or errors.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2020-06-19T16:50:46.976Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":3,"reads":36,"readers_count":35,"score":22.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":6213,"topic_slug":"android-glsl-not-rendering","display_username":"Brian Knox","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1334,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":37958,"name":"SirNate0","username":"SirNate0","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/9f8e36/{size}.png","created_at":"2020-06-19T23:17:42.254Z","cooked":"\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDoes your plane model work with the built-in shaders?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDoes your shader work with other models?
