Therefore when the client loads the scene, it simply won’t have have the ScriptObjects (which are intended for the server only). But that way you lose the ability to edit or view a meaningful portion of the game scene within the editor. And I assume saving and loading the multiplayer scene would cause trouble, since the client now also gets any existing ScriptObjects when it loads the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would prefer to have as much control over the development of the game from within the editor as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes anybody know how I can keep this flexibility while still being able to prevent the client from loading ScriptObjects that are intended for the server?\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:02:39.871Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":6,"reads":7,"readers_count":6,"score":31.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":751,"topic_slug":"scriptobjects-saved-to-the-scene-in-a-multiplayer-scenario","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":39,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":4132,"name":"Yao Wei Tjong","username":"weitjong","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/weitjong/{size}/4_2.png","created_at":"2015-01-16T03:40:46.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eHow about by creating those nodes or components using LOCAL CreateMode as opposed to REPLICATED (the default mode)?

On the other hand, a scene should care about networking as little as possible, as it should be just a hierarchy / storage for scene nodes, so I don’t particularly like the idea as a core feature.

And when I press play in the editor, I can see the lighting change in real time. I’m using attribute animation with keyframes to rotate (and also some other things, like changing the brightness) the node.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf the client loads that script and deletes it, the attribute animation will persist. Of course, I could remove it in Stop(), but I tried that and I had to use objectAnimation (since there is no RemoveAttributeAnimation function), and for some reason the node’s objectAnimation was null in Stop() when I tried to access it…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding you last suggestion, I suppose you mean I should, for example, add a bool member to the ScriptObject class, and only execute the ScriptObject’s code if it was not toggled (remember I need the editor to be able to execute it). And the client code should search for all of those ScriptObjects in the scene and toggle the bool value, and not run the code. But there the problem is, the Start() function has already run before I could toggle the value!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut maybe I’m misunderstanding how the editor works when you press play?
