The build system in the latest master branch has been refactored heavily.

I believe you have used cmake-gui instead of one of the provided build script. Using cmake-gui is actually just as fine, but then you have to take care yourself the difference between 1.32 and latest master branch due to the build system refactoring. In the 1.32 the main CMakeLists.txt is in the Source/ subdirectory while in the latest master branch it is in the top directory (project root where you have checked out the repo).
