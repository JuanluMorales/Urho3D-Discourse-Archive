I viewed the sample provided by Urho3D. Seems that it only uses .ani animation file.
Does Urho3D support any other animation format files?

Welcome to our forum.
Current urho3d only support .ani format, but you can convert other animation to ani format.

Hey winderman, welcome. As Aster said, Urho3d supports [url=http://assimp.sourceforge.net/main_features_formats.html]Assimp formats[/url] that converts to the engine's own animated format (ani) with the use of blender/max exporter or the assetimporter tool.  :slight_smile:
