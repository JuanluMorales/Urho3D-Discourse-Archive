Hi

Would anyone be interested in aiding me with the Existence client. It should be decent enougth for creating a procedual content rule base system ground and space exploration client standalone. 

My youtube channel have all the features I would like. I know someone made a basic lobby and chat system, and network protocol system.

Anyway, just a thought.
