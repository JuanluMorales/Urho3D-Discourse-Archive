With a few manual tweaks on the CMake build script, I was able to use the new compiler toolchain to compile the Urho3D library, however, it failed to link the library with the sample targets.

Previously we could not use all the logical CPU to perform the web build because they would get choked during linking phase, now that is not true anymore (at least on my test). I have now modified the ‘make’ task in Rakefile to take advantage of all the available logical unit automatically, and also altered the Web CI build to use 4 parallel threads instead of 2. The Web CI can now build all the samples (without any exclusion) and still have plenty of time left. That’s the good news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bad news are, 1) Emscripten does not support asm.js anymore and 2) the SHARED lib type still hit by the linker error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom what I have read, the new backend when configured with WASM=0 will emit plain JS as output instead of asm.js. The Emscripten keeps WASM=0 mode for older browsers that do not support WASM (those that support asm.js also support WASM anyway). In my experiment that took forever to complete for our sample build targets. Thus, if there is no objections from others then as part of the migration to the new backend, I will modify Urho3D build system to drop the support for EMSCRIPTEN_WASM=0. Effectively removing that build option all together because WASM will be enabled by default all the way. I will also drop the other experimental build option to build Urho3D as a “MODULE” lib type. It was introduced by me at the time it looked like a nice idea because Emscripten’s linking phase was so slow. So, that will be gone too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the SHARED lib type linker error, I have logged it as an issue in the upstream Emscripten. See \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/9726\"\u003ehttps://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/9726\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBTW, all the changes are currently only available in my personal fork. I am thinking of merging them into upstream Urho3D before releasing 1.8, despite it maybe a breaking change to some.

It appears the latest 1.39.5 has a breaking change and caused an exception to be thrown. The EMCC 1.39.0 to 1.39.4 does not have this problem. Fortunately, the (quick) fix is simple. I have made another commit to add a setting to revert back the generated JS script to its previous behavior.

It still has the same rendering artifacts as before due to WebGL but I did not able to crash it anymore with mouse move event. I recall this sample will crash using the fastcomp backend with the trap mode leave to “allow”, its default. So, it could mean the new LLVM backend has different kind of behavior by default. I found this explanation in the Emscripten documentation, which may be relevant (\u003ca href=\"https://emscripten.org/docs/compiling/WebAssembly.html#llvm-wasm-backend\"\u003ehttps://emscripten.org/docs/compiling/WebAssembly.html#llvm-wasm-backend\u003c/a\u003e).
