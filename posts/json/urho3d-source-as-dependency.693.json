Both Urho3D project and your own dependent project can be generated by the existing CMake build scripts as per normal. To the IDE, it really does not matter how your project files are actually generated, whether it is created by the IDE itself or generated somewhere else. A project is a project. I know for the fact that both Eclipse IDE and Xcode IDE support the feature of setting up one project as dependency of another project. Now one just needs to read on the IDE guide on how to set it up. Your project may depend on Urho3D and any other external libraries that you build from source yourself, whether they use CMake generator or not. The IDE also does not care about that. In short, you don’t need to alter the existing CMake build scripts to achieve what you want to do. However, you are right about the need to tweak the generated Xcode project for this to work. The second you drag and drop things in the Xcode, your Xcode project start to divert from the original generated one. There is no way to prevent that.
