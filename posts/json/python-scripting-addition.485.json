First I guess you’d need to find your ideal binding helper code/library and there’s many to choose from (boost::python, shiboken, swig, cython, Py++) or just the vanilla API. Or, you could make a C-API to Urho3D and use ctypes. Lots of ways to go about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI for one would really \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e like bindings for Python for easy integration into 3D DCC packages. I wouldn’t use it for anything runtime though due to performance. I’d recommend boost::python, and Py++ would make it even easier (it sits on top of boost::python and uses gcc’s xml backend to generate the bindings) but it isn’t maintained. Shiboken is what Qt uses but the library is LGPL unless you don’t mind dynamic linking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo start, I’d look into the C++ public headers of Urho3D and see what you need to bind.
