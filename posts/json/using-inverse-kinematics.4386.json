This is especially easy in 2D where you can only get 2 solutions at most. You‚Äôll just have to choose whether you want the one that bends your knee ‚Äúleft‚Äù or ‚Äúright‚Äù.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to animate with more than 2 bones, things aren‚Äôt as easy. The current algorithm used in Urho3D (FABRIK) is not suitable for IK driven animation because it‚Äôs not based on any physical model and will produce unnatural looking results if the solved tree is far away from the initial tree. It‚Äôs very fast though and it is suitable for small adjustments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am actively working on a new algorithm JSandusky made me aware of which uses masses and springs to find a solution. This algorithm would be suitable for 3-or-more-bone IK driven animation, because it is aware of the distribution of mass within the character, i.e. each joint specifies a ‚Äúweight‚Äù parameter such that the ‚Äúheavier‚Äù joints move slower while the ‚Äúlighter‚Äù joints move faster. It can produce some very natural looking results if you tune the weight parameters correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have made a little bit of progress but nothing that really works yet. My attention has been more on getting constraints to work.
