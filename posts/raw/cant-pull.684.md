Im getting this error:

[code]roger@serenity ~/projects/Urho3D $ git pull
remote: Counting objects: 60, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (60/60), done.
error: insufficient permission for adding an object to repository database .git/objects
fatal: failed to write object
fatal: unpack-objects failed[/code]

I updated last friday without problems. Is there any way to solve this other than cloning the repo again?
