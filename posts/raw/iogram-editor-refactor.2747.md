Finally I have emerged from the total chaos of a major refactor...I absolutely hate that feeling of ripping apart working code...But I also love the feeling of better architecture...so....

In any case, here is a preview of the new Iogram Editor, complete with modular windows, multiple views, sketching tool (@Lumak used your DrawTool here...), MultiLineEdit...

Sketch component! I like the idea of being able to use this as a kind of generic slider/curve input.
