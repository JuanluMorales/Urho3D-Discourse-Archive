Can you use sprites to make a game like doom with this engine?

I'm pretty sure you can with any 3d engine.
Check out this game by practicing01, it has sprite characters running around.

You can use Urho2D stuff in 3D space, including the sprite stuff. However the axis is set, so if you need your sprites in any orientation besides X/Y, you will need to derive from those components or create your own.
