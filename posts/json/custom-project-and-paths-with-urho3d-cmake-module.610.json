If you want to use Urho3D macros and modules then you have to structure your project to what it expects. Or you can tweak it to your heart content to suit your own project need. Currently Urho3D project structure has a project root dir which is the parent directory of the source tree (where the main CMakeLists.txt resides), the build tree(s), and all the other non-source subdirs (such as assets and docs). I suppose you have put your main CMakeLists.txt at the top level directory in your own project, so effectively making your top dir becoming the source tree as well and therefore the module get confused. If your own project structure differs from the module’s current expectation/assumption then using our module as it is will hinder you more than actually helping you. Having said that, it occurs to me that a lot of you like to have your main CMakeLists.txt to be resided in the project root/top directory, so it may be time for another build script refactor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003caside class=\"quote\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/sabotage3d/40/87_1.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003e sabotage3d:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have also compiled Urho3D IOS static libraries to custom location which doesn’t play nice with the Urho3d common module.

There is nothing magical about these modules. If you build the library into some custom location, how would it know where to find it? Currently the FindUrho3D module has two finding modes. 1) It finds the library using URHO3D_HOME environment variable. 2) It finds the library (SDK installation) using CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH environment variable (need to be provided when the library is not installed to the system-wide default destination such as “/usr/local” on Linux host). For the second mode to work, you need to use the documented SDK installation step to install the Urho3D library (and its header files) into a custom location of your choice.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:01:39.535Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":1,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":7,"readers_count":6,"score":1.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":610,"topic_slug":"custom-project-and-paths-with-urho3d-cmake-module","display_username":"Yao Wei Tjong","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"Admin","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":4,"hidden":false,"trust_level":4,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":3350,"name":"","username":"sabotage3d","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/sabotage3d/{size}/87_2.png","created_at":"2014-12-02T10:13:03.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThank you weitjong,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know that similar issues were discussed before.
