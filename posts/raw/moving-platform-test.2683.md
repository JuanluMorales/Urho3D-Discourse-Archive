Another feature I've yet tested.  I was concerned about whether platforms, character, or camera would jitter when on a platform.

I'm sharing the video as an inspiration -- I know I need more inspiration.

It looks great. Can you post some sample code? I struggled with similar problem for a while.

I just have a bunch of test code atm and still not satisfied with the dynamics on the horizontal moving platform.
