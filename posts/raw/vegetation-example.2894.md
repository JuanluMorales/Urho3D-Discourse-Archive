Is there any vegetation rendering example for Urho3D? Like this one for Ogre: http://www.ogre3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=85626

Hey smellymumbler,

For the grass part, you can check out Lumak's  10K grass nodes..

Hope that helps.

Is there anything like automatic billboarding for trees and stuff?

I have written some vegetation stuff including grass, billboards, per-instance wind and smooth LOD transition, but it is pretty dirty and I haven't published it.

So, it is _possible_ in Urho via almost standard rendering classes.

I'd like to see this released, dirty or not, and have others contribute to it.

@Lumak

I am not going to support this repo.
However, if one find this code useful, one may use it.
