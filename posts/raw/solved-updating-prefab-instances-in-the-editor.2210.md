Hi all.  Sorry if this is a dumb question.
I made a prefab in the editor and instanced it in another scene, but it seems further changes are not applied to instances.

Will I need to write a workaround?  Or am I simply doing it wrong?

More info:
-Exporting static scenes is not an option because the environment is quite destructible
-Multiedit helps, but is still painful, especially with multiple scenes

Thanks in advance for any tips!

EDIT
Problem solved.  I wrote an editor hack to get around this.  If anyone's interested:
