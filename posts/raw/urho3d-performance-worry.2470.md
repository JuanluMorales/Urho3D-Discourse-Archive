As this engine is so lightful and I am a OpenSceneGraph user before, I am wondering it's performance for my 
big model on android and IOS. Now I have to use xamarin to develop 3d app, but the OpenSceneGraph is not 
that fit for xamarin.

Now I am investigating that which is more suitable for developing under xamarin platform, and with performance request.

All C++ examples can show benchmarks, but some codes need to be fine tuned to get best performance, such as the parameters of physics engine, etc.
