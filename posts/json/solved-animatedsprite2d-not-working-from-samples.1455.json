I‚Äôm Having a really strange issue. I was trying to get my own 2d sprite going but for some reason it wasn‚Äôt showing up on the screen. So for a sanity check I tried to compile the Urho2dSpriterAnimation sample code. It compiled fine, opened fine but the sprite wan‚Äôt showing up. Tried compiling the other examples samples and everything else is working as it should it‚Äôs just 2D animated sprites that seem to be not showing up on screen.\u003cbr\u003e\nHas anyone else had this problem?\u003cbr\u003e\nAny ideas what could possibly be going on?\u003cbr\u003e\n(Using VS2015 windows 10 64 bit)\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks \u003cimg
