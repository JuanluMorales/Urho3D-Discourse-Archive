I‚Äôll try to explain a basic scenario where this happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere‚Äôs a C++ component CComponent that stores a matrix (Vector\u0026lt;Vector\u0026gt;) as a member field (not a pointer but the actual matrix). There‚Äôs a CComponent instance in the current scene and neither the component nor its node get deleted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStructType holds a couple of integers and bools and a SharedPtr\u003ca\u003eUrho3D::Node\u003c/a\u003e. Also, CComponent has two functions: retrieveNode(i,j) and storeNode(i,j,Node* node) that do exactly what their names say, get and set a node reference from a position in the matrix for a CComponent instance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, retrieveNode and storeNode are registered as: Node@ retrieveNode(int i, int j) and void storeNode(int i, int j, Node@ node), to the script API, and here comes the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a script (ScriptA) I get a node from the scene subsystem and do this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003eNode@ node = scene.getNode(id)\nccomponent_instance.storeNode(i,j,node);\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd from a script B, I do:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003evoid Update(float timeStep) {\n    ...\n    Node@ node = ccomponent_instance.retrieveNode(i,j);\n    //do things to that node, like getting a component and asking for values, nothing unusual\n}\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing is that each time I retrieve a node pointer from CComponent its refcount decreases by one, until it gets to 0 and then the pointer gets auto-deleted, I checked that by printing the Refs() value for the node before returning it in CComponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI checked the source where the ScriptAPI is being registered to see if I was missing something and I saw that all references to class pointers like Node* were declared like Node@+, changing that fixed the issue and now the RefCount remains the same after calling the function from a Script several times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think the @+ is the right way to do it, and I‚Äôve been able to read from the AngelScript documentation that it‚Äôs an ‚ÄúAuto handle‚Äù, but I don‚Äôt quite get what that means and how AddRef and ReleaseRef are actually implemented in Urho.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould anyone please clarify this to me a bit more? I‚Äôm kind of lost‚Ä¶\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks!\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:02:43.154Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":3,"reads":2,"readers_count":1,"score":15.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":758,"topic_slug":"agelscripts-and-and-why-pointers-get-auto-deleted","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":125,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false}],"stream":[4167]},"timeline_lookup":[[1,2867]],"suggested_topics":[{"id":7081,"title":"Install
