So we select subset of bones we want for ragdoll\u003cbr\u003e\nand set them to a category, also setting masses and constraint axes (could not find\u003cbr\u003e\nhow to do this automagically).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course doing\u003cbr\u003e\nthis I’ve met a lot of first-type problems of showstopper kind and would appreciate all\u003cbr\u003e\nhelp with these.\u003cbr\u003e\nMy current completion status is here: \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/rsq9gtbxb4E\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eyoutu.be/rsq9gtbxb4E\u003c/a\u003e so\u003cbr\u003e\nto visually show the idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I come up with is 3D model displayed in view and allowing to select bones\u003cbr\u003e\nand do various things:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to implement a way for user to see which local bone axes point in which direction,\u003cbr\u003e\nso I need to draw such geometry. As I understand I just need to add StaticModel to bone node\u003cbr\u003e\nwhich shows axes and the bone transform for bone node will do the rest. Is it correct?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to indicate the selection, i.e. I need to show which bone is selected on 3D model.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe best would be to show what bone is current among axes. The direction axes are pointing is important\u003cbr\u003e\nfor constraints use and placement, while dependency is not really well grasped yet.\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso I need to know the length of bone. Basically I need to know 2 points - base and tip,\u003cbr\u003e\nso I could draw some geometry on top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition I need to visualize collision shapes - I wanted to go cheap way and use debug geometry for that,\u003cbr\u003e\nbut somehow this doesn’t work as debug geometry is somehow overdrawn by actual model geometry (can be seen\u003cbr\u003e\non video). But if debug geometry can be made working that would be much better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf these 3 problems get solved the rest seems to be trivial to do. I just wonder why nobody did this yet?\u003cbr\u003e\n(or is there some works in the area?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks!\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:15:24.533Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":1,"reads":4,"readers_count":3,"score":5.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":2440,"topic_slug":"proper-selection-indicatio-etc-for-ragdoll-editor","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://youtu.be/rsq9gtbxb4E","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Urho3D- ragdoll editor prototype - YouTube","clicks":0}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":554,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":14598,"name":"","username":"Mike","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/58f4c7/{size}.png","created_at":"2016-11-30T11:23:05.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eI think first and only step is to procedurally generate the ragdoll.
