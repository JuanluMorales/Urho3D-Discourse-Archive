Hi, I have two questions:

How to get material parameters in shader? 
How to set shader unifroms from c++ side?

I know they are basic, but I havent found answer for them.

Thanks for help.

Ok I just found that: https://urho3d.fandom.com/wiki/Custom_shader_parameters
Weird that I overlooked that earlier.
I think I got everything I needed. :smiley:

Hi and welcome to the forums! :confetti_ball:

[Related Pages](https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/pages.html) section is easily-missed.

Off topic, yeah I share the opinion that it is easily missed. Something to keep in mind when we revamp the website one day.
