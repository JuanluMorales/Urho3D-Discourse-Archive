When I tell the render path to enable the “Underwater” tag there’s a good chance based on what’s currently being rendered that the shader wont draw properly. If the “Underwater” tag is enabled as soon as possible, then it works 90% of the time. I have no idea what could be going wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://imgur.com/a/l33PksD\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\u003eImgur: The magic of the Internet\u003c/a\u003e shows the failure (top image) and the success (bottom image). To generate these images, I simply ran the test app (the shader failed), hit print screen, closed the app, ran it again (the shader worked this second time with no changes on my part), hit print screen, and closed the app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeems like some kind of initialization problem.

If a shader needs, ie, tangent coords, make sure it is getting proper tangent coords or it will just use whatever random bullshit is left in there. Same thing with textures. If a texture slot is used, make sure a texture is being bound to that slot or it’ll just get random bullshit. Sometimes the random BS is okay-ish and the shader might seem to work, but then something in a frame is different and it doesn’t work anymore.
