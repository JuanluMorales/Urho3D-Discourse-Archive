If it doesn’t, then all that time is being spent waiting for a buffer swap of some kind. If it does, then there is some blockage in the display pipe. I wouldn’t be surprised if your AR devices force vsync. IOS devices do this as well, no way around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot too sure what ATW is, but you can always use \u003ccode\u003eUrho3D::Timer\u003c/code\u003e class to get timings between different events, and insert delay with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003e    m_timer.Reset();\n\twhile (true)\n\t{\n\t    elapsed = m_timer.GetUSec(false);\n\t    if (elapsed \u0026gt;= delay)\n\t        break;\n\n\t    // Sleep if 1 ms or more off the frame limiting goal\n\t    if (delay - elapsed \u0026gt;= 1000LL)\n\t    {\n\t        auto sleepTime = (unsigned)((delay - elapsed) / 1000LL);\n\t        Time::Sleep(sleepTime);\n\t    }\n\t}\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis actually gives me an interesting idea for improving vsync (I have a silly experimental vsync controller project). To reduce input lag, you want the delta between ‘input consumption’ and ‘display new frame’ to be very low. This way input collected in frame A affects frame B. Vsync adds a big delay between input consumption and frame display, so input on frame A may be collected while frame B is waiting to be displayed. So instead, move the vsync delay to E_ENDFRAME, which is the only event between \u003ccode\u003eSDL_GL_SwapWindow()\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eE_BEGINFRAME\u003c/code\u003e where inputs are consumed. Perhaps this is ATW? The main cost is more frequent frame losses, which may be avoidable to some extent.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":6,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2020-11-02T18:56:42.128Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":5,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":2,"reads":27,"readers_count":26,"score":20.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":6496,"topic_slug":"latency-reduction-for-ar","display_username":null,"primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":4,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"reply_to_user":{"username":"Simeon","name":"Siméon Schwab","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/e9a140/{size}.png"},"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1363,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":39802,"name":"Eugene Kozlov","username":"Eugene","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/eugene/{size}/902_2.png","created_at":"2020-11-02T18:58:53.599Z","cooked":"\u003caside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Simeon\" data-post=\"5\" data-topic=\"6496\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/e9a140/40.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003e Simeon:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo there is a lost of time between the end of rendering (at E_ENDRENDERING event) and the actual display on monitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003eE_ENDRENDERING\u003c/code\u003e is the end of engine submitting draw commands to GPU.
