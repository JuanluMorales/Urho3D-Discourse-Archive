JFYI I prototype building generation. Now I can create floor plan for building contour.
I decided to have only perpendicular-wall buildings now, while it is easy to extend algorithm for any convex shape
later.

Currently I create apartments/large rooms like shops. The next step is
to create actual apartment rooms. Then I will create contours and doors and windows.
Just wanted to show this for motivation boost! :)
