So all objects in our map view will be positioned at Y=0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor 2D objects, we have them all positioned exactly at Y=0, to avoid the Skew, and then are using “RenderOrder” to set the Z-order.  This is working just great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, now we want to employ some 3D models into the mix, but we need the be able to control the Z-Order alongside those 2D graphics.  Since the 3D models have “height”, half of the model will be above ground, and half below ground… and it shows.   This is bad.  Instead we want to make sure the entire 3D model shows, and is not occluded by other objects… it needs to appear “fully on top”, despite it having parts of the model actually be further from camera that other layers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is the easiest way in Urho to do this?
