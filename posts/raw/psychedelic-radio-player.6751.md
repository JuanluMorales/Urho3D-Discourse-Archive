Just published a test version (discoverable by link) of my radio app:

Looks good! :)

Are you familiar with [Ektoplazm](https://ektoplazm.com)? It doesn't stream, but is a free psychedelic resource nonetheless.

No, I wasn't. But if you interested in other stations I can add them to the app.

The main reason for the app - to try win10/xbox deployment via UWP and pave the way for Urho projects to xbox.

Not until there's a Linux version available. :wink:

Sorry, I have no plans for linux release unless I'll find out-of-the-box media player library I can use. UWP and Android have MediaPlayer that just works with few lines of code + provides FFT in a callback.

Maybe it would be nice to have a video that provides a taste, in any case.
