The frame rate is okay.\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, when I tried to add RigidBody to each object, the frame rate drop hugely. Even if the collision_mask is 0 and mass = 0 (static rigidbody, collide with nothing). I only need those rigidbody (collision shape) for raycast detection. So I believe it’s wasting a lot of CPU running some unnecessary physics calculation (since there is no raycast added for my test scene).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI searched a little bit about bullet physics and found \u003ca href=\"https://pybullet.org/Bullet/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=13023\u0026amp;sid=11f3a1ba6d3eb322fed1b625a5fa7da2#p13023\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\u003ethis post\u003c/a\u003e.

One kernel to bin into a grid and another to test + write the compacted hits+rayID. CPU side you’ll just sort the hits for each ray because you probably want the nearest one to the ray origin, not sorting on the GPU will keep you from trying to be clever (and shooting yourself in the foot) since sorting is hard there and you’ll likely have a fairly limited number of hits per frame in real cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you only have something like a thousand you can just brute force it in the kernel.
