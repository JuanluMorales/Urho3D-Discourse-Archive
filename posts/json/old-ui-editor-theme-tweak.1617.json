This was done a couple of years ago with Urho 1.3 and during Google Group days. The interface was still simple back then with just the menu bar and a couple of windows. I did not bother to share it because it was not fully completed and was just meant for my own personal use. I also could not obtain the copy anymore because I recently found out that this was included with my failed hard drive, along with other old dev stuff but fortunately I found these 2 screenshots that I got inside my docs folder while I was doing my monthly file cleanup routine. The theme was inspired by dark theme engine editors like Unity Pro, CrySDK, UE4, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I have the time I would definitely redo this with an updated version, but I’m currently busy in completing a demo right now. I hope this should give you guys added motivation on what can be done with Urho3D’s flexible UI system, though I would still prefer a C++ Qt library version for a solid editor and have the builtin UI just for in-game stuff.  \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=9\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echeers.  \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=9\" title=\":smiley:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":smiley:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/QyWXt87.jpg\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/QyWXt87l.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"448\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/0DslKtH.png\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/0DslKtHl.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"440\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:08:57.030Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":112,"reads":14,"readers_count":13,"score":562.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":1617,"topic_slug":"old-ui-editor-theme-tweak","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://i.imgur.com/QyWXt87.jpg","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"QyWXt87.jpg","clicks":16},{"url":"http://i.imgur.com/0DslKtH.png","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"0DslKtH.png","clicks":9},{"url":"http://discourse.urho3d.io/t/ui-tweaks/1595/11","internal":true,"reflection":true,"title":"UI tweaks","clicks":1}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":54,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":9332,"name":"","username":"Enhex","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/enhex/{size}/81_2.png","created_at":"2015-12-25T01:22:22.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eLooks good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBTW Qt isn’t standard C++, and has awful requirements to build from source.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:09:01.310Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":1,"reads":14,"readers_count":13,"score":7.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":1617,"topic_slug":"old-ui-editor-theme-tweak","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":184,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":9335,"name":"","username":"umen","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/u/ec9cab/{size}.png","created_at":"2015-12-25T12:38:23.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eHow do you embed SDL2 into Qt 5 widget ? and event loop this is a problem .\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":3,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:09:01.526Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":1,"reads":14,"readers_count":13,"score":7.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":1617,"topic_slug":"old-ui-editor-theme-tweak","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":79,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":9368,"name":"","username":"rasteron","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/rasteron/{size}/55_2.png","created_at":"2015-12-26T21:57:31.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/enhex\"\u003e@Enhex\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[quote]Looks good.\u003cbr\u003e\nBTW Qt isn’t standard C++, and has awful requirements to build from source.[/quote]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks. I’m not sure about Qt not being standard C++ and how it would relate in creating a replacement game editor, but any framework and libraries has pros and cons. You don’t need to build Qt from source to create a decent working prototype and there’s a lot of opensource Qt widgets that you won’t find anywhere else or would take some time to
