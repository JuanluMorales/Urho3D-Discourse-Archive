I'm trying to make a really basic platformer. So far, I can make the player character move just fine using RigidBody and ApplyImpulse, and I can also make camera orbit around the player. However, I'm struggling with making the character's movement follow the angle of the camera. I want to move in the direction of the camera by pressing forward (W), move in a direction 90Â° to the right of wherever the camera's pointing when I press right (D), move directly towards the camera by pressing back (S) and so on.

For reference, [here's a pastebin with all the code I have so far](https://pastebin.com/xqUvQzcp).

Sorry if this is too obvious of a thing to ask about - as you may be able to tell from my code, I'm an absolute beginner :smiley:

Instead of moving along the fixed world axes you should take the rotation of the camera node into account.

Check out example 18 (Character Demo), if I have understood you correctly it should do exactly what you want to achieve (except maybe locking the character to the camera. But that shouldn't be hard to change).

The movement code I'm using comes from the Character Demo, actually! So it's not quite what I want, as it still moves the RigidBody relative to the *character*'s direction as opposed to the *camera*'s. (the Character Demo forces the character to always face in the direction of the camera, but I want to avoid doing that)

Would using `cameraNode->GetWorldDirection()` and such as the direction of your impulse give you what you want?

After ramming my head against the wall for a while, I finally managed to come up with something. [You can check it out here](https://pastebin.com/dxaNYx1Q) (this pastebin only includes the changed parts). It's a very *caveman* solution that may have to be completely rewritten whenever I get around to analog controller support but hey, for now it works and that's what matters.
