It should just have the root CMakeLists.txt in the \u003cem\u003eroot\u003c/em\u003e directory, subdirectory imports for the main project, tools, etc…, each of which can have their setups including forcing the local system for certain projects or using a toolchain file to specify, say, android for others.

We have adapted the LuaJIT original Makefile to our CMake build scripts. The original LuaJIT Makefile can build host tool “buildvm” using native toolchain at the same time it builds the cross-platform target library using the cross-compiling toolchain. I don’t know whether CMake has changed since then but at the time I tackled this, I found CMake to be:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[ul][li] incapable of configuring a host build when it is being invoked with a cross-compiling toolchain[/li]\u003cbr\u003e\n[li] incapable of changing toolchain or using several toolchains in a single build[/li][/ul]\u003cbr\u003e\nI have checked a few CMake build scripts from other projects that attempt to build LuaJIT library and none of them meet our need. Most throw away so much logic from the original Makefile that they either work only in one platform or resort to some forms of hard-coding. In the end I decided to write the CMake adaptation of the original LuaJIT Makefile from scratch myself. At least our implementation works across all the platforms supported by Urho3D, barring iOS platform as there is no point to build it for this platform. In fact the adapted CMake build script supports all the platforms supported by LuaJIT itself (PS3/4, XBox, PPC, etc). The only thing that is not nice about it is this, it always assumes the host tool location where it can find the “buildvm” to be in “Bin” directory regardless and that the tool itself must have been built natively prior to cross-compiling build. Note that the “buildvm” tool is a different binary for each targeted platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are welcome to contribute if you think there is better way to do this or if you can improve on top of what we have.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:01:18.939Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":1,"reads":4,"readers_count":3,"score":5.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":547,"topic_slug":"cross-compiling","display_username":"Yao Wei Tjong","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"Admin","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":4,"hidden":false,"trust_level":4,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":3082,"name":"","username":"OvermindDL1","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/o/a8b319/{size}.png","created_at":"2014-11-13T20:49:28.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eAh!  In that case there are two main ways, one is fully in-cmake but is a pain and not generally recommended due to the pain, the other way is to use CMake’s \u003ca href=\"http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/module/ExternalProject.html\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eExternalProject\u003c/a\u003e built-in system, which was added in 2.6 or 2.8 or so.  Basically just have multiple projects, like tools that should always be built for the host OS you can put in one project, things that should build for potentially multiple things in another.  From your main project just ExternalProject_Add and pass in the arguments you need.  So for example, one way it can be set up is to have your ‘main’ project (which really really \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e badly should be a CMakeLists.txt in the \u003cem\u003eroot\u003c/em\u003e of the git tree, even if it just starts immediately going to a subdirectory like Source) be the platform that you want to build to, the TARGET platform.  Have it ExternalProject_Add the tools that need to be run on the local HOST system, when it builds you can then ExternalProject_Get_Property to get the variables from that external project, such as the location of the binary to use in a build step elsewhere say for code generation or atlas generation or whatever you need, or bring in include files and the library path to link to (well not that part for cross-compiling obviously).  Once you bring in the variables just name them whatever you want and use them as normal, as if they are just in your project.  With ExternalProject Cross-Compiling with host-only tools became \u003cem\u003emuch\u003c/em\u003e easier.  \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt ‘should’ be completely possible to do an entire and complete CMake build system nowadays without an overuse of Macros either, such as the output ‘Bin’ directory really should not exist, the resultant binaries and Data directories should be in the build directory for if people want to test, and the Install commands should let the user install it where-ever they wish.  Then with proper CTest and CPack support you could make travis just fly and make installers that are far easier to include in other projects.  Plus if the CMake build follows proper standards (such as generating the definition file that points to the local library, data, configuration vars, etc… of the build) then bringing in Urho3D into an external project without needing to pre-compile or anything would be utterly simple.
