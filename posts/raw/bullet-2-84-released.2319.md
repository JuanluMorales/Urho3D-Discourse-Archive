I don't know if any of their changes are relevant to Urho (bugfixes perhaps?), but here's the announcement:

Apparently it brings inverse kinematics support, which would be an excellent feature to have.

I googled bullet 2.84 IK demo and came up empty. Is there a demo?

My guess is at this point no -- currently I don't think they've even updated the documentation, but it looks like there might be such a component in the video they have showing 2.84 off.

Do we have cloth physics yet?

It's actually 2.85. Urho already had [url=https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/blob/master/Source/ThirdParty/Bullet/VERSION]2.84[/url] last time I checked.
