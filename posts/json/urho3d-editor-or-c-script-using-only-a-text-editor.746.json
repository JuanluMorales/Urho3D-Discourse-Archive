I like the Urho3D Editor and it’s extremely awesome what it does particularly in real-time editing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebut I was wondering how to best get started with Urho3D using text editors like gedit?

That’s for sure if you are working on a serious or large project. GEDIT just won’t cut it even when you have enabled all the developer-friendly plugins. Personally I use “vi” though (I am joking of course, but no, I am quite serious). The good IDE candidates are (not in any particular order): Code::Blocks, Eclipse (with CDT plugin), and Qt Creator. Both Mint and Ubuntu should have these IDE software packages available in their repository, so installing them is very easy. You should learn how to perform a debug run in the IDE of your choice. That should reduce the number of change/rebuild/run iterations considerably while ironing out any logic error. However, you should use the provided “Editor” app (not the text editor) to see the effect of changing the box size or other attributes.

Urho3D Android project is Java project with C/C++ native code. With an Android IDE you should have no problem to debug into the Java side of the code. But it is another story to cross the border boundary to the C/C++ native side of the code. Let’s not get ahead of yourself. I think you can find it on Google easy enough on how to deploy Android app into your Android device and those instructions should work on Urho3D app. But, I think you need to create your Android project first  \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=10\" title=\":smiley:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":smiley:\"\u003e  .
