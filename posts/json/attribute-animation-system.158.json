One thing that would be nice to have is to choose time(or event) which determines the change. I’m talking here specifically about variable timestep when rendering and fixed timestep driven by physics. The second one is important to make the animation deterministic. I can imagine animating position of the node with collision shape and rigidbody(something like elevator) and it would have the same positions over the time when using fixed time. Using variable timestep could cause some unexpected results, let’s say there is 1 sec lag or whatever and then the animating body would be teleported away a large distance (causing the player fall from the elevator).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: checked the branch and i see that E_SCENEPOSTUPDATE is used, which is variable timestep. What I would suggest is to create boolean flag like “Fixed Timestep” to subscribe to E_PHYSICSPRESTEP or E_PHYSICSPOSTSTEP\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T00:58:30.206Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":8,"readers_count":7,"score":1.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":158,"topic_slug":"attribute-animation-system","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":13,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":857,"name":"","username":"friesencr","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/friesencr/{size}/827_2.png","created_at":"2014-03-22T20:48:09.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThanks for working on this Aster.

Can an animation attribute have weighting? Things like (in Maya terms) driver driven keys could be used where a complex animation scheme could be driven by a handful of other keys eg. if you had a skeleton for a character and some bones have keyframes, have secondary bones which are driven by those primary bones at certain angles (so if bone1 rotates by 75 degrees in Y, move bone2 by 10 units in X). I worked on a AAA title doing art and character stuff ages ago, and we exported driver/driven keys into XML which defined this kind of data and the game engine would do the linking, very
