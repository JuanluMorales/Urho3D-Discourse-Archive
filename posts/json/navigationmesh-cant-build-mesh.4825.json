And tile size?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m assuming the agent radius for both cases, is a value used in calculating the navigation path and uses the radius as a sphere used during the calculation to ensure the agent can get to that point given it’s size. And that radius should be the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/lezak\"\u003e@lezak\u003c/a\u003e Have not specifically added a debug renderer, as started with \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/xamarin/urho-samples/blob/master/HoloLens/06_CrowdNavigation/Program.cs\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ethis sample cod\u003c/a\u003ee which also doesn’t.

Too few and navigation doesn’t work well. When I upped it to \u0026gt; 2000, the navigation improved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCellsize of 0.08 seemed the best balance between errors and navigation expediency and success. The agent setting on NavigationPushiness also plays a role. In my case there is no happy medium between the settings Medium and High and None loses all crowd control, and the agents end up as one occupying the same space. At high, the navigation result is good but the end result suffers as they group too closely, at medium the navigation suffers and in the end they’re grouped too loosely, and radius settings didn’t seem to help that much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTile size didn’t seem to make much difference except in the number of errors that appear. I only used values of 16 and up. At 64 everything seems to work nicely, same at 32, 96, and 128. At 128 no errors, at 32 a lot. At 64 six errors at 72 eight errors, at 96 three errors. Frankly I couldn’t make any sense of this except there is generally a linear relationship, but can figure out why errors go up going from 64 to 72, when in most other cases increasing tile size reduced the error count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, this was way too time consuming. There needs to be some sort of useful documentation on the relationship between cell size, tile size and errors being generated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, even the slightest bit of info on why the error is at all generated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe debug was immensely helpful and quickened the pace once it worked.
