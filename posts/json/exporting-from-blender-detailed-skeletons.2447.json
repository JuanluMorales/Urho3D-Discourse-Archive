While many people say that ‚Äúyour player have too much time to notice things in your game‚Äù and\u003cbr\u003e\n\"you don‚Äôt ever need so many bones\" are pure bullshit and lack of eyesight. We generally don‚Äôt make graphics for blind people,\u003cbr\u003e\nand what other thing player do except watching out animations, even heavy on fight? Also to notice, not all genres contain fight\u003cbr\u003e\neven.\u003cbr\u003e\nSo as I justified the need for \u0026gt; 20 bones (\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003esorry for including the above part, but I really tired of explaining obvious things each time I ask about this problem\u003c/span\u003e), how do we handle the problem? The actual skeletons can contain many bones,\u003cbr\u003e\nthe problem is bone-per-mesh value should not be \u0026gt; 20. First I thought it was per \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003eVertexBuffer\u003c/span\u003e value, so I tried to cheat\u003cbr\u003e\nusing different materials, so having material groups split mesh, but that doesn‚Äôt work at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat works is actually \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003esplitting mesh\u003c/span\u003e. So if we split-out dense areas (hands, feet, head, ‚Ä¶) we‚Äôre fine. And yes, that works.\u003cbr\u003e\nBut there is problem - visible seam, which happens because normal smoothing in Blender is disrupted by splitting.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe fixing probably can be done in script code if splits are done in places, where normals end-up quite close even after split,\u003cbr\u003e\ni.e. when we split not at wrist but spilt forearm in half. This way we can detect same vertices throughout the meshes and averaging their normals (making them the same). \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003eThis is slow, though, and all the data is known at export time.\u003c/span\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the question is - why not autosplit the mesh in exporter? This should be easy enough. Also I think this can be done\u003cbr\u003e\nby loader, too, or by engine tools. We know all bone groups, so we can split mesh by bone groups and then join closest in 20\u003cbr\u003e\ncounts. That would let me avoid doing routine work in Blender then slow work in script.\u003cbr\u003e\nDoesn‚Äôt it sound like a good idea? Where to go with it?\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:15:26.946Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":10,"reads":7,"readers_count":6,"score":53.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":2447,"topic_slug":"exporting-from-blender-detailed-skeletons","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":554,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":14661,"name":"","username":"rasteron","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/rasteron/{size}/55_2.png","created_at":"2016-12-06T23:06:36.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThis looks like a feature request with Blender Urho3D exporter.
