what material technique does it have? What if you assign some other object's material to it?

it is the model caused this problem.

that's weird. Don't know why it could be so. Try renaming problem.mdl into sphere.mdl, try applying material instead of materialList, check if there are multiple meshes in this model. upload a file.
