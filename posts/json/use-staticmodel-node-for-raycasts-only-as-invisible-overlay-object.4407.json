If I am rendering the combined object (one vertex buffer) the performance is okay, but the raycast can’t determine a subobject other then \u003ccode\u003e0\u003c/code\u003e, understandably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo my idea was: taking the one-vertex-buffer model to render the models (that’s hidden from the raycast via viewmask) and use a multiple-vertex-buffer model that’s hidden from the camera to do a raycast to determine the selected subobject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if I do this the performance drops as low as if I use the multiple-vertex-buffer model for rendering.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe only noticeable performance boost was possible if I disabled the multiple-vertex-buffer model, but on a disabled node the raycast does not work either. Setting the multiple-vertex-buffer models \u003ccode\u003eViewMask\u003c/code\u003e to \u003ccode\u003e0x00000000\u003c/code\u003e or setting its \u003ccode\u003eDrawDistance\u003c/code\u003e to \u003ccode\u003e0\u003c/code\u003e or a very high value (100000) has no effect on the performance. I also tried to set the \u003ccode\u003eOcludee\u003c/code\u003e property to \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e, with no noticeable impact.\u003cbr\u003e\nThat’s quite interesting in my opinion. Shouldn’t setting a models \u003ccode\u003eViewMask\u003c/code\u003e to \u003ccode\u003e0x00000000\u003c/code\u003e prevent it from rendering, because it’s invisible for the cameras? But it seems as the vertex buffers still get transferred to the graphics card and causing some performance trouble there. I can not imagine that the raycast hits the performance so hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre there any ideas out there, how to prevent a StaticModel from rendering? (Or an other idea how to perform the model selection?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo ideas I still have are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eloading the submodels as CollisionShapes and perform a physics raycast (but I think the physics engine will die with that many objects),\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ecreating a color coded texture and select the object according to the color at the position where the raycast hits the texture (the problem here is to unwrap the model(s) in blender, because they are very large with high polygon count (~500000 all together) and not easy to unwrap).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebest regards,\u003cbr\u003e\nahorn42\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2018-07-25T16:06:20.797Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":80,"reads":42,"readers_count":41,"score":413.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":4407,"topic_slug":"use-staticmodel-node-for-raycasts-only-as-invisible-overlay-object","display_username":"Ahorn42","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1011,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":25390,"name":"Eugene Kozlov","username":"Eugene","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/eugene/{size}/902_2.png","created_at":"2018-07-25T22:23:10.822Z","cooked":"\u003caside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"ahorn42\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"4407\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/a/97f17d/40.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003e ahorn42:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShouldn’t setting a models \u003ccode\u003eViewMask\u003c/code\u003e to \u003ccode\u003e0x00000000\u003c/code\u003e prevent it from rendering, because it’s invisible for the cameras?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003eModel\u003c/code\u003e (and so, \u003ccode\u003eVertexBuffer\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eIndexBuffer\u003c/code\u003e) is always created in GPU memory.\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, model with zero view mask shall not be rendered.\u003cbr\u003e\nAre you sure that your multiple-vertex-buffer model is not rendered?\u003cbr\u003e\nEnsure that you don’t use this model as occlud\u003cstrong\u003eer\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003caside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"ahorn42\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"4407\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/a/97f17d/40.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003e ahorn42:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only noticeable performance boost was possible if I disabled the multiple-vertex-buffer model, but on a disabled node the raycast does not work either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have known set of Drawable-s to ray test, nothing prevents you from calling \u003ccode\u003eProcessRayQuery\u003c/code\u003e manually.
