As far as I remember, when layout mode is active then the parent UI-element will grow as big as its children required by default (which is what you want). It does not evenly divide the parent width/height equally to the number of children like you have described. For example, if you have vertical layout parent element without any child elements yet then the height of the parent element will be zero initially and the height will be adjusted automatically to accommodate its children as they are being added. When adding big number of children, you may want to disable this auto layout adjustment first and reenable it back after all the children have been added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the flip side, you may actually want to limit the parent size to grow to a certain max value, like in a list view. You don’t want the view to become as long as the list items it contains.
