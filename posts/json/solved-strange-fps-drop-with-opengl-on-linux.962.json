I think there is a high chance its a driver issue, but I noticed that I had quite terrible performance on windows 10 as well with open gl, which again could be just windows 10 and not every single driver for my computer working correctly. Edit: Looks like this is more an issue I have in linux rather than also a thing in windows 10. On win 10, I simply just have terrible performance with opengl, and that is most likely a driver issue or some sort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I do is as following in linux mint:\u003cbr\u003e\nI fly back so that I see, everything moving. Then I resize the window by hitting alt+enter a couple of times. After a few resizes the fps just drops down a lot. Like it could be 200 fps in the beginning, after resizing couple of times, it drops down to 30 or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOriginally I was using window-resizable and it seems to make the fps drop quite often, since it resizes once in the beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe this has something to do with context? Like if there is too much stuff to load on size change, and it isnt finished or something, it does some really weird stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain as said this could be completely my computers own driver problem. I noticed with linux I do have some problems with ALSA from time to time and my gpu has had some issues before with various things (Ati HD 5870), so I wouldn’t be surprised if this doesn’t affect anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitial fps, 1920x1040ish\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/iC2EekR.jpg\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttp://i.imgur.com/iC2EekR.jpg\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter resizing it few times, something x something (smaller resolution)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/xy185QI.png\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttp://i.imgur.com/xy185QI.png\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: Actually I can simply use alt+enter couple of times, so there is no need to even make the window resizable or any code change to 06_SkeletalAnimation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit2: It doesn’t seem to affect windows 10 for me. I simply just have terrible performance on win 10 with opengl, probably due to bad drivers or some sort of driver conflict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit3: Forgot to mention, that if I use windowed mode, and I keep resizing it after the fps drop, it might actually suddenly get higher fps than the initial. Also what happens with the higher fps is that it starts to blink, like in some frames you can see through the window or something.\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso forgot to mention, that this existed before the opengl3 render-change.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:04:28.143Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":1405,"reads":8,"readers_count":7,"score":7026.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":962,"topic_slug":"solved-strange-fps-drop-with-opengl-on-linux","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://i.imgur.com/iC2EekR.jpg","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"iC2EekR.jpg","clicks":40},{"url":"http://i.imgur.com/xy185QI.png","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"xy185QI.png","clicks":22}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":205,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":5595,"name":"","username":"GoogleBot42","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/googlebot42/{size}/62_2.png","created_at":"2015-03-30T23:34:53.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThat seems really weird… what happens if you change the screen size and then change it back to the original number?

This is probably pretty good for some fast paced games + dual monitor, where you accidentally might click outside of window, something along a rts-type of a game.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf I do not use the setcursor, the mouse moves while holding right button, even if its invisible, meaning it might move on top of button, and upon releasing it resets its position. Though with the android I do not really want to see the cursor on the screen, so this is probably the behaviour I do want to have. This on the otherhand doesn’t lock the cursor to the screen. The game I am trying to make would be turn based game, where mouse should freely go out of the window, and the window size preferably should be readjustable. I suppose some setting of mouse position on every frame would probably fix the problem of hovering over ui-objects while holding right mouse down would be a simple fix for me in my case.\u003cbr\u003e\nAlthough I think there was some way to change the behaviour of the mouse even with the visibility of mouse, but using the cursor also creates cursor on android phone, which I want to avoid doing.\u003cbr\u003e\nSo I guess either changing mouse behaviour during resize or setting mouse visibility to true while resizing, then restoring after resize is done could be one way to solve the automatic shrink?\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":12,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:04:29.735Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":1,"incoming_link_count":1,"reads":8,"readers_count":7,"score":6.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":962,"topic_slug":"solved-strange-fps-drop-with-opengl-on-linux","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":205,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":5616,"name":"Lasse Öörni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2015-04-01T10:43:23.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eFrom what I remember, the resize used to work OK on all desktop platforms, but either the new mouse modes or Emscripten support broke it.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":13,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:04:29.799Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":7,"readers_count":6,"score":1.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":962,"topic_slug":"solved-strange-fps-drop-with-opengl-on-linux","display_username":"Lasse Öörni","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"Urho3D Author","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":3,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":5620,"name":"","username":"TikariSakari","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/t/f4b2a3/{size}.png","created_at":"2015-04-01T15:30:00.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eWell looks like its not completely gone. I still haven’t been able to make the blinking thing happen, but it happens sometimes, very rare though now after the changes into the context creation code than it did before the reformat and urho code changes. I do have a theory tho. Even on this installation I did use the package that completely wiped my opengl2 drivers because I wanted to be sure that it was that one package that caused me some problems, and installed amds drivers after installing the package. My theory is, that it sometimes doesn’t use the propierity drivers when creating context, and uses mesa-drivers or something, this could be pretty far fetched though.

Then when it runs at roughly 140fps full screen on open gl 3, my gpu utilization is at 100%, this is the normal speed. With opengl 2, it can runs bit faster (170-200) fps, depending on what viewing angle I am using. If it has to draw into full area, the fps is a bit lower than when it tries to draw everything on a portion of the window.

After the fix, the windows resize problem only occurs on certain circumstances, i.e. it depends on how I cover and uncover the window. I now suspect the root cause of the problem is at the SDL side. The SDL_GetWindowFlags() function may return a wrong result with respect to SDL_WINDOW_MOUSE_FOCUS flag. SDL may erroneously report true for this flag when clearly my mouse is not hovering on top of the window. Unfortunately, when SDL returns a bogus result then our code reaches here \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/blob/master/Source/Urho3D/Input/Input.cpp#L371\"\u003egithub.com/urho3d/Urho3D/blob/m … t.cpp#L371\u003c/a\u003e. It should not reach there when SDL returns a good result and the check at line 358 stops it. I don’t have the stomach to mess with SDL today so I will just leave it for now. To be fair, this could be SDL or Gnome3 fault.
