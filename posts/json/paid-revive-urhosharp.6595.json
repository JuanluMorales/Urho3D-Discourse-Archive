We have also elected to use UrhoSharp as our rendering engine, and it’s working out very well so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there are a few bugs in the UrhoSharp.Forms code, as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you navigate to a new Page, it disposes/stops the Urho Application.   So when you come back to the page that hosts Urho, we have to re-start Urho App from scratch!.. this causes lag, and thrashes memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTouch Input is skewed on any view of Urho where it doesn’t consume the full window / screen.

I think it’s just an oversight in how they wrapped this for XamarinForms.  The rest of our app remains intact, and doesn’t dispose.   The C# context that hosts Urho sharp remains fully intact - -it’s just that the Navigate operation itself makes a purposed decision to call “StopApplication” on the Urho App when you navigate to a new page.  Everything else about the previous page is still the \u003cem\u003esame instance\u003c/em\u003e – nothing is disposed…   Only Urho.
