[quote="cin"]What licence to this model?[/quote]

No idea, no find license in the web or video, only say:
- "I have given away some source files for this character ... mainly with the idea to help others that might be on the road to becoming game character artists and want to check out the model/textures/psd layout and what not ... but do with them as you wish." - "do with them as you wish".

I give all license/attribution to Paul Tosca.
