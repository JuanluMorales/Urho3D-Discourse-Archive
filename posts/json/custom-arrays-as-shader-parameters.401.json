I’m working on a shader that projects a grid over any kind of surface myself and I found textures to be like hack-ish for that purpose, in the sense that a texture is not meant to store the kind of custom data that I’m using, and it tends to get screwed easily with image editors when you’re treating the binary data as anything else but colors. Even so, I’m using textures and they’re working perfectly so I guess I don’t need to worry as much.
