Hi Guys,
I noticed that SetAutoRemove is not available in the new build.

I found there is a SetAutoRemoveMode.  Which mode is similar to the SetAutoRemove (true)?

Thanks

`REMOVE_COMPONENT` is equivalent to the [old behaviour](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/commit/3fe5024cf7939bccad32c30e2d89051d2b20c446#diff-09e5f32dec51149656529680ef071232L343-L357).
