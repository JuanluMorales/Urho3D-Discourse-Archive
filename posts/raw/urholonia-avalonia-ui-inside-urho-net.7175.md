This is built off @elix22 Urho.NET, where he also did the heavy lifting of integrating it with Avalonia.

Here I've kludged Avalonia to produce Outline Fonts (which in their next version will NOT require my kludge).    Their transparency over Urho works perfectly, and everything looks pristine pixel-perfect as Avalonia does.

The end goal here is to publish this as "Urholonia" - which enables Avalonia to be used as both as your Game's Modding Toolset, as well as the In-Game UI (as shown below).
