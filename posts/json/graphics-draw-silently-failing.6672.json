If the conditions are not met, Draw just silently returns, making it impossible to tell if the call succeeded from both the calling code (e.g. a boolean success state return) and from the log.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003e#if !defined(GL_ES_VERSION_2_0) || defined(__EMSCRIPTEN__)\n    if (!indexCount || !indexBuffer_ || !indexBuffer_-\u0026gt;GetGPUObjectName() || !instancingSupport_)\n        return;\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis ended up making it a ~3 hour process to figure out why the ImGui integration was failing to draw on an Emscripten build, rather than a ~3 minute process.
