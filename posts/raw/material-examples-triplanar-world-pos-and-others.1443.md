Is possible to have examples of how to use World Possition and triplanar materials i like to do something like what i got in UE4 ?:

- 1) Material when you move the model/mesh is like if the material are projected in the world and is static so then when you move the model you see how the material move too because is static. (You can scale the model and the texture scale too)
- 2) Material triplanar. (Good for terrains etc)
- 3) Material mix between the two before in local space (You can sale the model and the texture scale too in static way). [dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/280 ... -46-57.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28070491/URho3D/Forums/2015-10-22_14-46-57.png)

Hey Hevedy,

As for Triplanar materials/texturing, have a look at gawag's Urho3d wikia page for some examples.

[urho3d.wikia.com/wiki/Tri-Planar_Texturing](http://urho3d.wikia.com/wiki/Tri-Planar_Texturing)

hope that helps :slight_smile:

Thanks you I not familiar with this but i go to try that.

So and for Triplanar local ? Where you move or rotate the model and the texture is static ? Like my posted pic. Only scale when yous scale the model basically
