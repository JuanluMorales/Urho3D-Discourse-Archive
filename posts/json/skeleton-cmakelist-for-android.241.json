We have gone an extra mile to ensure that external project can find the Urho3D library, provided the external project is being setup correctly as per documentation. You can study the Rakefile script closely how it uses cmake_gcc.sh single-handedly to configure the projects for Linux, Windows, Android, and Raspberry Pi. You can see that it can achieve all this with the same set of CMakeLists.txt.

However, it stops short to configure the toolchain part.
