Hey guys, today we have a surprise for you. We?re releasing the source code for Serious Engine v1.10! It?s the very same engine that we used for Serious Sam Classic: The First Encounter and The Second Encounter.
...
And it?s even better today! Obviously, Serious Engine v1.10 won?t produce top-notch graphics, but the source code is very well commented, easy to modify, and there are lots of user generated mods out there. This version has everything you need to build your own game ? or just experiment.

That news just came in and it may be useful to learn or to see how other engines are designed.
Haven't even looked at it but it could be interesting.

Yeh, it is good to learn from the source, but I suggest you if you want to learn the source idtech4 is good too, also on c++ side the Data-Oriented Design and c++ by Mike Acton talk on Cpp-Conference is a good options too, also CPP JeffPreshing How Ubisoft Dev Multicore Games, I think new engine era is much more efficient.

Agree, I guess it's too little, too late. I'd be more psyched if they had released the latest engine version instead, kinda like what CryTek just announced today. For educational purpose.. it's all good.
