I have read documentation about Urho2D usage, but can not find answer for this question. I also modified tilemap example - I have replaced moving the orthogonal camera with rotating the perspective, but, as far as I can see, no perspective transformation applied to tiles - only rectangle silhouette was changed. So, it's simpler to write my own tile map for 3D from scratch?
