All they need to focus on is game logic.\u003cbr\u003e\nEven for game logic, the don’t need to start from scratch. They can build their world on top of other world, like making an expansion.\u003cbr\u003e\nWith the platform’s IDE, making an online board game is just a piece of cake.

During the process I keep refining my ideas and refactoring the codes.\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the end the platform has gone beyond board game. Now theoretically you can even build a MOBA game with this platform.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis video demonstrates World_Order, which is the very first game I want to make.
