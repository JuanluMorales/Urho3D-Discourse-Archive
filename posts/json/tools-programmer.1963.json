I would not mind teaming up with someone if we find common ground on various things. But i do not think you could count on me as person who would take care of that list alone. I do not want to get paid, i dont mind opensourcing my code, all i want is good tools to use. Currently for my editor im using imgui which iFire pointed me to. Idea is same like yours - so editor can be used in-game. It works pretty sweet. Due to immediate mode of gui any changes to scene from anywhere (be it game code or editor) are immediately reflected in GUI. Im not moving forward as fast as i wanted though, so i suppose working with few other people with a same goal could be beneficial to all of us.
