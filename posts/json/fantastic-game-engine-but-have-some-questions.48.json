It literally is the most complete open source c++ game engine out there with a viable and realistic license (in my opinion). All the other actual free C++ based engines I’ve encountered are very fragmented and missing most of the functionality Urho3D has. They also require the user to hunt down many libraries and implement them themselves, making these engines nearly out of the question for all novice programmers. Then we have the commercial alternatives. Almost all of these have heavily crippled free versions and do not allow any source access unless you pay an insane amount of funds which is virtually impossible for indi devs who aren’t millionaires. So there you have it; could Urho3D possibly be the greatest indi game engine of all time? I sure think so!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have all but decided to use this engine for a serious game project I’ve been conceptualizing for over a year now. I’d also love to contribute whatever improvements I make to help further the cause of Urho3D which I think seems to be making an actual complete, multi-platform game engine of commercial quality that doesn’t have an overly restrictive viral license available to the public for the first time (correct me if I’m wrong here but I really don’t think there is anything even close to comparable out there at the moment).  The engine looks nearly perfect for my indi game endeavor but I have a few quick questions regarding the engine’s core structure/api for the devs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003e1.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWould it be feasible (not insanely difficult) to create an in-game level editing system in c++ by using the same calls made to the angel script editor within the Urho3D player?\u003cbr\u003e\nDoes the engine’s code structure allow for this or would it simply be out of the question?  I’m asking because my second engine choice was actually Cube 2(aka Sauerbraten) or the improved version known as “Tesseract” which has one of the best level editing systems I’ve seen in any game/engine, not just open source. I’d even  considered porting some of it’s functionality over to Urho3d as they both have a very permissive license\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003e2. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCan the engine be compiled with LUA only  and exclude the angelscript library/add-on since I do not intend to use angel script?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003e3. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIs the networking system currently fully integrated with all the supported platforms?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last two are both requests and questions I suppose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003e4. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNow that asm.js can run at only 1.5x slower than native code (as of 12-21-13) will the devs consider targeting browsers as a viable platform using emscripten, which I’m sure most are aware is capable of compiling c++ code  and even open gl es   2.0 graphic programming straight to  javascript with little to no modification/cleanup required in the code. Epic games has made full use of this and now there is even an actual full fledged commercial\u003cbr\u003e\nreleased  called “Monster Madness” that uses this technology. It’s also worth pointing out that the entire LUA vm has already been fully compiled to java script using emscripten and runs at near native speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003e5.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nDo you plan to implement support for Oculus Rift VR in the future?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you very much,\u003cbr\u003e\nJace\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T00:57:35.337Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":102,"reads":11,"readers_count":10,"score":512.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":48,"topic_slug":"fantastic-game-engine-but-have-some-questions","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":27,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":100,"name":"Yao Wei Tjong","username":"weitjong","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/weitjong/{size}/4_2.png","created_at":"2014-01-25T05:58:52.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eWelcome to our new forum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to stick around with Urho3D after observing how stable it is compared to Ogre3D and after learning how clean the source codes are compared with others.

If I recall correctly I have seen comment or commit log somewhere that indicates the Editor was once written in native C++ language before being rewritten using AngelScript (Lasse would know better). Although it was quite sometime ago before Editor acquires much of improvements recently. The underlying interfaces being used by the Editor scripts via AngelScript API are available also in native C++, so I would say it is feasible. Having said that, I know at least one construct in the Editor scripts that uses AngelScript special features like “funcdef” (it is almost like a closure but not quite the same) for implementing menu callbacks. You will have to replace those AngelScript special constructs in C++.[/li]\u003cbr\u003e\n[li] Yes, it can.

Neither of those engines are multi-platform either, but there is work being done by one guy to get Torque3D compiled for the other platforms with crowd funding. Torque3D appears to be the only real competitor Urho3D has.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince both of the other aforementioned engines have full support for Occuls VR already and use the Sdl2 for graphics (wip linux port of Torque3D only) it would probably make things a lot easier to see how they implemented it. Actually, you may even be able to get some compensation for your time and work by starting a donation Paypal. Torque3D seems to be gaining a lot of new functionality that way so why not Urho3D as well? I guess the core devs would have to approve something like that, though, as I don’t know how they stand on donations since there really isn’t any info about it on the site that I could see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack to the subject of networking, by looking at the classes it seems the Knet library is very tightly integrated with the scene system of Urho3D.

These are sent as unreliable and old values don’t matter to the client.

Our license says “the software is provided ‘as is’ without warranty of any kind…” and if we were taking money, that shouldn’t / couldn’t be strictly true any more, and could open up possibilities of ugly situations.
