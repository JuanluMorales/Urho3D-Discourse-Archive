Hi there

Great engine, great editor, and well Im having some minor difficulty.

Loaded edtitor.as and tried to import a 35k OBJ mesh (montain scene for game), and all I can see, is a blue box around it.

I changed camera view from 1000 to 10000 thinking that would be enough.

What am I missing atm :wink:?

thx

Was there anything in the logs?  Did you import as a scene or a model?

Got one of my obj's to show  up.im just not used to this editor at all...I'll keep working on it :wink:

ty for engine,,seems once I get used to editor it may provide a great stepping stone into a decent  game.

Okay, the obj I'm trying to load in, is a     export from Sculptris ( latest).

It shows up perfectly fine in blender, as a obj import.

I've got a screen to share, to hopefully show  what I see here.

I changed camera far setting to 10000 from 1000, thinking that might fix it, but no go, all I get after zooming in a long ways, is a green box, no mesh.

Here is pic:
