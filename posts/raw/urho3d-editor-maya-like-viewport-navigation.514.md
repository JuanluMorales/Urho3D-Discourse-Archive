Hello ,

I would like to make a request as I am not from Blender background. I am mostly using Maya and Houdini. Is it possible to have Maya like navigation scheme in Urho3d Editor. 
For example these would be very useful:
[u]
[b]Tumble, Track, or Dolly[/b][/u]
	 	 
Alt + Left mouse button [u]Tumble Tool (press and release)[/u]

Alt + Middle mouse button [u] Track Tool (press and release)[/u]

Alt + Right mouse button [u]Dolly Tool (press and release)[/u]

f - to focus on selected object ( zooms into the selected object in the direction of the camera)

Thanks in advance,

Alex

It should be noted that the current method of Urho3D Editor navigation is not a bit like a navigation in Blender. 

And I'd like that, would it have been like in a blender)
