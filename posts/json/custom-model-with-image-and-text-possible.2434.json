In this case, a grid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStep 1: In the editor, create a local node.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, a lot of game logic, or logic that can be attached to nodes, are done with ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù.\u003cbr\u003e\nSo far, you have a node in the scene. Which is nothing more than a invisible point in a scene that has transformation information. Or simply information on where in the 3d scene the node is, and the rotation and scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStep 2: If you want a simple grid to put on an image, with the node selected. add a ‚Äústatic mesh‚Äù component.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis static mesh component will allow you to load in any static mdl. Urho has a few general ones.\u003cbr\u003e\nYou should see a paramaters pane in the editor for your static mesh component, that you can choose to load the mdl onto. Select the Grid.mdl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStep3:\u003cbr\u003e\nFinally to get a image on this grid.\u003cbr\u003e\nWithin the same static mesh component, after you have loaded the grid mdl, there is another paramater further down, that you can choose a material. (Im not infront of a working urho build, so the instructions might be a little incorrect). I would just try a simple material, Lit maybe, or DefaultLit.\u003cbr\u003e\nYou should be able to inspect the material, and load a local image into the diffuse parameter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStep 4: You might need to add a light to the scene as well.\u003cbr\u003e\nMake a node, make a light component, and change the light to directional. and rotate it so it lights up your grid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis should get you a very very basic set up.\u003cbr\u003e\n(when I am infront of a proper urho build, I can save out a scene.xml that you can load, if you havent managed to get this far)\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:15:23.972Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":2,"reads":13,"readers_count":12,"score":12.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":2434,"topic_slug":"custom-model-with-image-and-text-possible","display_username":"Jimmy
