But when I started making some tests I realised  there’s no reload feature for LUA scripts, so I have to restart the whole editor for script changes to take effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs ChrisMAN_mk2 pointed out on the IRC channel, there’s really no such feature in the Editor’s code, and I was just wondering why.

This is done by using a custom function that urho3d passes to lua scripts for creating components.  Every time “ScriptObject()” is called in lua the result is guaranteed to be a new empty component.  Lua allocates the table that holds the functions and then lua passes a pointer to urho3d that represents the table (I think it is a bit different than a pointer but here we can think of it as just a pointer).  Then the lua script sets the lua functions inside that table.  And the app is run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the script is reloaded… “ScriptObject()” is called again.  But a different table returned not the original.  This is because it is impossible for urho3d to know that the component already exists (without extra parameters added to ScriptObject() ).
