Is it possible to get a dump of this forum's SQL and assets so the site doesn't go down, there is a lot of info in here that would suck to lose. Are there any mirrors out there?

The site is hosted by the Discourse team for free as part of an open source community initiative:
https://blog.discourse.org/2016/03/free-discourse-forum-hosting-for-community-friendly-github-projects/

I don't see any reason to make any forums SQL dump publicly available considering it likely contains password hashes and email addresses. In any case, I recommend for users on this forum to make use of the github sign-in and change their discourse.urho3d.io passwords to something impossible.
