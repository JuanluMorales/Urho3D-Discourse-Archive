You can define a \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003ecomplete\u003c/span\u003e on-screen joystick UI layout using the Editor app or hand-coded the XML manually. Since we have a lot of sample apps and most of them can share a basic same layout, our approach is to use this basic UI layout and then specialized it as needed using the XML patching mechanism for each sample. But to answer your question directly, there is no special option required to enable this XML patching mechanism. The patching mechanism is available for \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003eany\u003c/span\u003e XML resources and not just limited to UI layout XML file.
