Hi all

Just thought I'd share what I have been working on, it's a relatively simple procedurally generated dungeon-crawler, just for fun :-)

I hope to release a functioning version sometime this year, open-source naturally.

That looks really nice!

Also welcome to the forums! :confetti_ball: :smiley:

Scariest part is the shadow you cast at 1:21.  I don't know what that is, but it ain't human.

Is that skeleton doing a [haka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haka), btw? :)

@Kronix
It's the default female model from Mixamo, and yes it's a very friendly dungeon... for now :smiling_imp:

@Modanung
I was thinking more a'la disco-dance, but animating is clearly not my forte :-)

Both dancing and animating can be pretty tough to get right, animating a believable dance requires understanding both. Practice makes perfect, though. Also character is more important than quality in a game, I think. :slight_smile:
