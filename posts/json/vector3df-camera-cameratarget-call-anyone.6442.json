I tried it with the example, and the urho fish decal just slips in trails from odd frames, but does lay its mesh decal. I know its a ‚Äòframe‚Äô engine too and not just a slobber fest. The Raycasting code btw, seems top notch quality easy to use - with the benefit of an enhanced resultQuery to query Node types so easily in the Update scenario‚Ä¶which is great for games.\u003cbr\u003e\nFor my purposes, I pulled about 20 things from the Demo‚Äôs to successfully port my 2project over to Urho, and I was up and running in 3 days work, with another few days for the scaffolding.\u003cbr\u003e\nAlso, the api is good enough!..many of the functions, such as the Quaternion function to represent not just a rotation - but a new axis set and an angle around that set - have enough documentation to track exactly what you need.
