Currently a significant part of the UI-layout serialization logic is there just to filter out those UI styling attributes from being “saved” again in the layout file.

Those XPath filtering logic could be thrown out when the proposed UI skin/style and content separation is being implemented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also agree with removing the ‘singleton’-ness of the UI root hierarchy. It should again make implementation of UI editor simpler than currently.

Having the UI render as a renderpath command would quite easy and straightforward, however it could not be fully described with renderpath xml data, as it would need to refer to a live root UI element.

(*) You would just render the UI on top of the scene content using another camera and viewport that doesn’t clear the depth \u0026amp; color buffers, then finally apply any distortion post-processes. Of course if you wanted, you could even have UIPanel’s as a part of your main scene, for example some holographic display.
