How can I get a return value when executing an AngelScript function/method from  C++?

I couldn't get asIScriptContext::GetReturn*() to work.

I suppose it depends on what you're trying to return and what code you've used. Without seeing the code I'm not sure anyone could do anything but guess.

I failed to reach this goal *shame*
Now I just pass object parameter and read it later.
