In the past we have let the event of new developer accepting the offer to join us as Urho3D project team members with full GitHub push privilege unannounced. But no more . :wink:  
We will start a new tradition to announce the event by making a new post in this announcement thread when one of you joins us.

hd_ ([member170.html](http://urho3d.prophpbb.com/member170.html)) has made tremendous contributions to our code base in the recent release and we are happy to inform you that he is now our latest team member. Welcome, hd_!

WOOHOO!   Thanks Mike for all the work!  Now importantly, 8 is great and all but with 9 we could be the Fellowship of the Fish.  I am reserving Gimli for myself.

-------------------------

Thanks to everyone for this awesome engine :smiley:

@TheComet and @Eugene are now officially the maintainers of our newly created team to manage the community repositories. TheComet is also now our newest team member in the Urho3D organization. Welcome aboard!

-------------------------

1vanK | 2017-08-12 10:17:59 UTC | #19

I'm ashamed to admit, but I did not find a link to the new organization

-------------------------

weitjong | 2017-08-12 10:24:33 UTC | #20

There is no new organization. We only created a new team inside the same Urho3D organization. https://github.com/orgs/urho3d/teams
But there is really nothing to see there yet.

The team maintainers should be able to create new sub-team.
All team members should be able to create new repository.

Arnis Lielturks @Miegamicis  is now one of our core team members. Please join me to welcome him.

-------------------------

Miegamicis | 2018-08-04 17:43:51 UTC | #22

Thanks!

I hope that I will be a great addon to existing team so that together we can further improve the engine with new and shiny features. Already have few ideas in mind! :)

@Miegamicis It's good to see the team gaining strength.
May your contributions be useful and many.
