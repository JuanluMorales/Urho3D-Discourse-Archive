Prototyping on Linux was a breeze and then later deploying to Android, and copying it over to a Mac Mini+XCode for iOS. The app is scripted in AngelScript, and I only used a small amount of iOS/Android-specific things like the accelerometer values which came out differently but that might be fixed now, and I used an OpenAL audio back-end on iOS because I had audio glitches, and added microphone capture support for iOS only \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/boberfly/Urho3D/tree/openal\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttps://github.com/boberfly/Urho3D/tree/openal\u003c/a\u003e. Exporting out animation and geometry was mostly reliable out of Maya via FBX for the pug dog and OBJ for the fence (I had issues with the normals getting flipped with FBX and the fence).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA notable point is that the engine footprint is much smaller than things like Unity3D, and you have the power to opt-out on building scripting support which should reduce the engine size dramatically by symbol stripping if you choose to code in C++ so that would be an important note for deployment. Some shaders probably need optimising though but you can read up on a lot of techniques if you‚Äôre not afraid of GLSL coding, but I only use simple 1-texture shaders so performance isn‚Äôt a problem and they compile fine on each mobile platform I‚Äôve tested them on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of these days I want to make another crazy action game, my first choice of engine would be Urho3D
