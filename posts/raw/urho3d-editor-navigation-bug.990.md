Hi I just compiled the latest Urho3d from github. And I have a fresh install of OSX Yosmite 10.10.2 . When I start the editor I am getting a snap with the mouse I cannot navigate with the mouse at all. It just snaps back to different position sometimes it flips. Any ideas ?

Thanks in advance,

Alex
