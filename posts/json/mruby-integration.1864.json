If the mruby own build system is also CMake based then it should be easier to do this integration, or otherwise you will have to adapt whatever build configuration file used by mruby into a new CMakeList.txt. Simply copying and replacing the stuff out from existing CMakeLists.txt from Lua and hope for the best, would probably not work. At the very least you need to first learn the CMake basic and then move on to study how to use our Urho3D own convenient macros. The macros that you posted below would only work as expected when you have also initialized the necessary CMake variables. If what you posted is the complete CMakeLists.txt then obviously you have missed out the initialization for the SOURCE_FILES CMake variable.
