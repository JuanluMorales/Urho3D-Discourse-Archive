Suppose you didn’t want that particular sample to inherit from Sample.h, but rather you just wanted a main.cpp in there which have code depending on Urho3D project. One more thing, suppose 100_MySample uses a header library with that code in directory a MyLibInclude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried this with the extra sample directory having this structure:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e100_MySample/\u003cbr\u003e\n|-- MyLibInclude/\u003cbr\u003e\n|-- CMakeLists.txt\u003cbr\u003e\n|-- main.cpp\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand the following CMakeLists.txt:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einclude_directories (\u003cbr\u003e\n\"${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/MyLibInclude\"\u003cbr\u003e\n)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eDefine target name\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eset (TARGET_NAME 100_MySample)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eSetup target with resource copying\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esetup_main_executable ()\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eSetup test cases\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esetup_test ()\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo basically the CMakeLists.txt is identical to that for all the other samples, except without the line\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edefine_source_files (EXTRA_H_FILES ${COMMON_SAMPLE_H_FILES})\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd up in the CMakeLists.txt for the Sample folder I added the line\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eadd_sample_subdirectory (100_MySample)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter running cmake a corresponding Visual Studio project is constructed for the Sample, but none of the code (i.e. main.cpp) is discovered.
