This affects IDE choice.  <strong>DirectX dominates the 3D gaming desktop.</strong></p>\n<p>I want to make money selling 3D games in either the RPG or 4X TBS genres, possibly combining aspects of both.</p>\n<p>Consoles are not a good fit to 4X, as the genre has tended to need a lot of keyboard shortcuts.  I suspect it is probably also much easier to play with a mouse or touchpad.  TBH I preferred using a full sized keyboard with a numeric keypad to move units around, but I\u2019ve gotten used to doing without that.  Although modern consoles do actually support keyboards and mice, it\u2019s not culturally what most people do, and probably not most people\u2019s living room setup either.</p>\n<p>Consoles are also not indie friendly.  There have been some attempts at indie consoles, say the Ouya or Steam Machines, but they have failed.</p>\n<p>Although some people on mobile phones want 4X games, I find the idea of giving that to them, kind of a joke.  I only believe in gaming on reasonably sized screens.  A touch tablet, maybe, but definitely not a phone.</p>\n<p>Mobile gamers also have limited attention spans.  4X games are long, and not suited to being broken up into the short attention span / multitasking / grab a few minutes here and there play attitudes of the mobile gaming demographic.  These don\u2019t look like desirable customers, at all.  There\u2019s a reason these platforms don\u2019t see much in the way of \u201cdeeply involved\u201d games.  They don\u2019t have the UI to support it, nor the customer attitudes to desire it, in enough volume to matter to a developer.  If someone wants to prove me wrong on these pronouncements, they\u2019re welcome to try their hand in the free market, but I\u2019m not going to.  Doesn\u2019t smell like any kind of money pot to me, it smells like fool\u2019s errand.</p>\n<p>Linux isn\u2019t a viable consumer gaming platform.  I did Linux recently for 3 years, waiting for Steam Machines to come save us all.  They didn\u2019t, they failed.  I gave up.  Linux just has too many distro and graphics stack politics to deal with, and no companies actually trying to make money in the consumer software space.  From a consumer usability standpoint it\u2019s a joke.  People do buy some games on Linux, but from a make money numbers standpoint, the math simply isn\u2019t there.  From an engineering and cultural reality standpoint, it never will be.  You spend enough time in the trenches with enough open source projects, and you\u2019ll realize why.  These people simply can\u2019t ship consumer software, they\u2019re clueless.  There\u2019s all kinds of dull boring things that need to happen for feeble ordinary people to be able to use software, and most of the FLOSS crowd is hardcore expert tweak this tweak that write programs for other programmers.  Only money changes most people\u2019s discipline in that regard, and like I said, no big corp is pushing to make money with Linux in consumer software.</p>\n<p>In the real world, 4X TBS is a desktop phenomenon.  That leaves Windows or MacOS as the candidates.  Windows is clearly the superior gaming platform to MacOS, in terms of customers.  I can\u2019t even remember if Apple has gotten in any way serious about game development.  For so many years, they didn\u2019t care about game developers at all.  Didn\u2019t fit with their \u201ccool upscale lifestyle\u201d music marketing or whatever.  Both platforms have proprietary 3D graphics APIs.</p>\n<p>OpenGL is toast.  The device driver deployment on Windows has historically been bad.  When you\u2019re selling products for money, this matters.  You can\u2019t just tell customers to tweak and fiddle and hope for their best.  Their 3D drivers have to work, and in the real world on Windows, those have been DirectX drivers.  Apple used to do OpenGL, but in recent years they\u2019ve been actively killing it in favor of Metal.</p>\n<p>OpenGL is also technically inferior to DirectX.  It\u2019s a crappy API with all the \u201cget a pointer\u201d dancing around.  It didn\u2019t do multitasking, although I haven\u2019t kept up on whether that\u2019s changed in more recent releases.  DX11 had multitasking.  Nobody would care if OpenGL has finally caught up <em>now</em>, as OpenGL has no future in gaming.  That\u2019s the whole story of OpenGL, too many years of not improving in industry fast enough.</p>\n<p>Vulkan isn\u2019t viable yet.  My recent research suggests that Microsoft has been more open source cooperative about Vulkan than I would have expected.  At least to the extent that their cooperation allows HLSL to become The One True Shading Language To Rule Them All.    Since my Commodity Graphics Group back at DEC was burned by Microsoft back in the day, my trust in them as a corporate entity is low.  The playbook of getting involved in some area, so that they can yank the rug out from under it later, is an old one.  I\u2019ll believe Vulkan is a viable commercial platform on Windows, when a lot of AAA game studios are shipping on Windows and it\u2019s clearly not a problem.</p>\n<p>I haven\u2019t studied Apple\u2019s politics about Vulkan, but I expect them to do everything possible to thwart it, in favor of Metal.</p>\n<p>In the real world, DirectX falls out of the bottom of my commercial gaming equation, as a necessary and unavoidable piece of the toolchain.  People have all kinds of options for writing <em>a</em> game.  But for what <em>I</em> want to do, it ends up being Windows and DirectX.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual Studio has some bells and whistles for DirectX debugging</strong>, that I\u2019m not fully up on yet.  It remains to be seen what I\u2019ll need in this regard.  What the production realities are.</p>\n<p>Me making money as an indie game developer, when I am currently <em>broke</em>, is far more crucial than any spyware code injection issues.  I don\u2019t have the luxury of avoiding the exit door to poverty, if I want to do it on my own terms as a game designer.  And no, I\u2019m not going to go write some other kind of game, just because someone is worried about an IDE injecting spyware.</p>\n<p>The issue of stopping code injections in a release build, is a problem I can take up, <em>when</em> I have a game that\u2019s near to shipping.  A lot could change before then.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Blow#JAI_language\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Jai</a> could finally come out.  I could invent my own language.  That\u2019s a more serious possibility now, as I find it very difficult to sign off on Lua 5.4 as a 3D graphics programming model.  And in any event I\u2019m not afraid of builds and build systems, as that\u2019s the last thing I made money on.  I\u2019m an old school ASM coder, I think I can handle some linkage issues if I <em>want</em> to handle them. I just know that \u201cspyware issues\u201d are <em>not</em> mission critical to me and will <em>not</em> help me with getting out of poverty.  I live out of a car.  I don\u2019t have time for such concerns.</p>\n<p>I check my \u201copt out, no, no, no thank you, oh hell no\u201d buttons early and often, when I install stuff.  That\u2019s what I\u2019m willing to do for now, and it\u2019s something other people can do.  The biggest impact from me choosing this way, is tech companies aren\u2019t going to get telemetry about genuine bugs in their products.  I find that regrettable, but since public trust about this sort of thing is pretty much broken, I\u2019m calling that collateral damage.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve never gone up a full security learning curve about Windows, ever.  I don\u2019t even install any kind of anti-virus software.  I let Windows Defender do stuff, and I\u2019ve been doing that since Windows Vista.  No harm has come of it.  My level of sophistication, has been running Malwarebytes manually every once in awhile, when I get suspicious.</p>\n<p>My philosophical attitude is that your security and privacy is to some extent an illusion.  Things are gonna snoop you, because even most techies don\u2019t have the time to whack all the security moles that are coming up all the time.  A person who wants to ruin computers, or infiltrate computers, can do so.  Nevermind a corporation or a government.  If you want to fight those battles against \u201cbig entities\u201d, you can try.  But you should consider whether this is <em>the battle of your life</em>, that really must be won.  I know that <em>my</em> battle is to produce Art, in the medium of computer games.  That battle is plenty hard enough, without adding extra ideological burdens on top of it.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s also a question of, when you get to the point of being willing to take on <em>additional concerns</em> to make a better world, <em>which</em> concerns of the many possible Social Justice concerns, are you going to take on?  'Cuz a solo developer certainly doesn\u2019t have time for all of them.  How about minority and gender representation in games?  How about accessibility?  There\u2019s a blind guy who posts in r/4Xgaming lately.  I <em>could try</em> to solve his problems, at some considerable technical cost to me as a developer.  Maybe I think that\u2019s more important than jousting at spyware?  Might depend on which problem turns out to be technically easier or harder.  There\u2019s also the question of which one is more <em>interesting</em> to work on.  I have ideas about the blind stuff.</p>", "post_number": 20, "post_type": 1, "updated_at": "2020-03-26T18:25:18.709Z", "reply_count": 2, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 0, "reads": 37, "readers_count": 36, "score": 17.4, "yours": false, "topic_id": 6016, "topic_slug": "choosing-a-c-ide", "display_username": "", "primary_group_name": null, "flair_name": null, "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": null, "flair_color": null, "version": 5, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_wiki": false, "link_counts": [{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Blow#JAI_language", "internal": false, "reflection": false, "title": "Jonathan Blow - Wikipedia", "clicks": 0}], "read": true, "user_title": null, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 294, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 2, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false}, {"id": 36959, "name": "SirNate0", "username": "SirNate0", "avatar_template": "https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/9f8e36/{size}.png", "created_at": "2020-03-26T20:41:33.724Z", "cooked": "<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"bvanevery\" data-post=\"20\" data-topic=\"6016\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/b/c77e96/40.png\" class=\"avatar\"> bvanevery:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My philosophical attitude is that your security and privacy is to some extent an illusion.

Because of the turned-based nature, a turn-based strategy game should be fine on mobile, as long as the state can be saved every turn and a turn can generally be completed in around a minute. Then the player is free to stop and come back later every turn, which is very similar to a lot of the mobile games out there where a level takes a minute or two to finish. In terms of the audience, who knows, it may be a lucky success and become fairly popular, it may not. That said, desktop is probably a better TBS target, especially given the touch interface and small screens of most mobile devices.
