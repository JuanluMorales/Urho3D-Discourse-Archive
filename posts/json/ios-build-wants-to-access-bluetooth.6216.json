It appears that instancing doesn’t work in my app in the metal build (I found the same problem in Urho1.7.1, that was fixed in the 1.8alpha and main branch).

This is a problem in 1.8alpha, the current Master branch, and your branch. It works fine on Windows, but some messages seem to be lost on  iOS, For example, I have a custom control that subscribes to E_DRAGBEGIN and E_DRAGEND as shown below. The handler function for E_DRAGBEGIN works, but the handler for E_DRAGEND doesn’t get called when the touch event is released (this all worked fine in version 1.5, and it also works fine in all versions I tested in Windows). There are other UI events that are not working as well on iOS (wrong function called when a button is pressed, nothing happening when other buttons are pressed). Not sure if anyone else is seeing these issues in iOS. Maybe if I get some time I’ll see if I can do a simple modification to one of the examples to see if I can get the problem to repeat on something I can share more easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eSubscribeToEvent(m_outer_circle, E_DRAGBEGIN, URHO3D_HANDLER(JZTouchCtrlWidget, HandleDragBegin));\n\tSubscribeToEvent(m_outer_circle, E_DRAGEND, URHO3D_HANDLER(JZTouchCtrlWidget, HandleDragEnd));\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e","post_number":10,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2020-06-25T06:12:49.929Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":20,"readers_count":19,"score":9.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":6216,"topic_slug":"ios-build-wants-to-access-bluetooth","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":367,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":38023,"name":"","username":"elix22","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/elix22/{size}/1437_2.png","created_at":"2020-06-26T09:51:53.125Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eI fixed the black screen issue on iOS OpenGL ES vanilla  , part of my master branch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt appears that instancing doesn’t work\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would need more information to tackle it  , some kind of code snippet , models ,textures and materials used .\u003cbr\u003e\nDid you try “20_HugeObjectCount” or “58_GeomReplicator” samples ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esome messages seem to be lost on iOS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes I am aware of it  , in my todo list of fixes.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":11,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2020-06-26T09:51:53.125Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":10,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":5,"reads":20,"readers_count":19,"score":29.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":6216,"topic_slug":"ios-build-wants-to-access-bluetooth","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"reply_to_user":{"username":"jzpekarek","name":"","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/j/9dc877/{size}.png"},"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":809,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":38026,"name":"","username":"jzpekarek","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/j/9dc877/{size}.png","created_at":"2020-06-27T04:56:57.829Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eIt might take me a few days, but I’ll try to see if I can reproduce it in something that is easier to reproduce.
