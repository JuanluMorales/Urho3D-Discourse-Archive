Urho3d is a full featured, multi platform, near zero bullshit, clean architecture,  fast c++ engine with low platform requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt has a familiar component model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would say the engine is API first meaning that you won’t see much code in the engine to serve the sole purpose for it’s editor. The editor is dependent on the core and not the other way around.

If you ever had to build Ogre3D during its prime you know what I mean.  It can also take a little while to understand its memory model.  It uses ref counting and has it’s own personality.

Bugs are usually fixed that same day.  So there is a lot of direct communication with the devs.  One disadvantage of a lot of other engines is that there is a bug disconnect between the users of the engine and the core devs.  Plus, new features are constantly being added.  (HTML5, DirectX11, and OpenGL3.1 support were just recently added.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso one of the main reasons I use this engine is because it has support built in for standard things that I would expect out of a game engine.
