Less than two weeks ago i started working on yet another Urho3D editor. It is not usable just yet, but it probably is in good-enough shape to be showed off, so here it is.
![editor|690x398](upload://rwQlMkABHsmMCQ04xLfVMMmaEu2.jpg)

Features:
* Uses [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for UI
* Scene hierarchy widget
* Attribute inspector widget supporting 99% of Urho3D variant types
* Material resource editor
* Mask widget (for light masks etc)
* Resource path browser widget
* Drag&drop for (some) resources
* Scene settings (renderpath, postprocess)
* Open multiple scene tabs
* Save/Open existing scenes
* Save/Open projects (project includes widget layout, opened scenes, various settings)
* HDPI support

Missing but planned features:
* Create/delete objects
* Undo/redo
* Objects for representing invisible scene nodes (like lights and cameras)
* Icons for components
* Save scene as a new resource
* Create new materials from scratch and save them
* Resource browser with previews
* Drag&Drop with previews
* UI layout editing in a new dedicated tab
* Many more i cant think of right now

Code at: https://github.com/rokups/Urho3D
If you wish to test it - be sure to use `-DURHO3D_TOOLS=ON` cmake parameter.

That looks quite nice.Will try it out. Thank you for sharing it.
What is the priority of the UI layout editor? I think it will be nice to have that as well.

That really is low in my TODO list. UIEditor itself is somewhat done, but it is in separate application and needs to be "just wired in". It's code too could definitely use some love too.

-------------------------

yushli1 | 2017-11-09 10:21:06 UTC | #4

I am just wondering how to design the UI editor that can let people design the UI once, then run seamlessly on any phones with different screen sizes and resolutions. Or how to do screen adaptation generally in Urho3D.

-------------------------

rku | 2017-11-09 10:24:44 UTC | #5

I solved this problem like so:
```cpp
GetSubsystem<UI>()->SetScale((float)GetGraphics()->GetWidth() / 1920.f);
```
UI was designed for 1080p resolution. It scales up or down on phones fine. Not sure how it would do on 4k screen on desktop though.

-------------------------

yushli1 | 2017-11-09 10:32:14 UTC | #6

Suppose you design for a screen size of 1000x1000(just an example), then it now needs to run on a screen with size of 1200x1000. The upper right button which is designed at the position of (1000,1000) can only be at position(1000,1000) and cannot reach the real upper right corner. A better solution may be to add a anchor choice to the UI editor, so that we can set this property to "upper right", then the button will stay at the actual desirable position at the running device.

-------------------------

rku | 2017-11-09 10:38:57 UTC | #7

UI already has these settings. They are called "Horiz Alignment" and "Vert Alignment".

-------------------------

yushli1 | 2017-11-09 10:40:36 UTC | #8

Will these settings be configurable in your up coming UI editor?

-------------------------

rku | 2017-11-09 10:51:04 UTC | #9

UIEditor (and Editor) present any registered attributes (`URHO3D_ATTRIBUTE` and similar macros) so yeah - these options are already available in standalone UIEditor and will be available once it gets merged to editor. In fact i am pretty sure official editor exposes them as well.

-------------------------

yushli1 | 2017-11-09 10:54:35 UTC | #10

Got it. I didn't use the official UI editor because there is no tutorial for a beginner. I will wait for your new UI editor, and hopefully you will have at least a simple beginner tutorial for some basic operations.

-------------------------

Eugene | 2017-11-09 13:12:56 UTC | #11

Looks interesting. I also wanted to try ImGUI for Editor but didn't actually tried it yet.
Have you faced any problems with ImGUI? Are built-in widgets bug-free?
What's performance of Hierarchy? Is it possible to implement drag&drop of hierarchy items in ImGUI?
Does ImGUI support OS files drag&drop?
I'll try the Editor this evening. Probably I should move this way.

-------------------------

rku | 2017-11-09 13:28:51 UTC | #12

> Have you faced any problems with ImGUI? Are built-in widgets bug-free?

Overall i am extremely happy with imgui. I havent noticed any bugs i would need to work around. One notable thing is that built in widgets for integers and doubles cast them to floats internally, so that may be source of issues at some point.

> Whatâ€™s performance of Hierarchy?

I have not noticed any performance issues so far. I even do some string formatting on every frame.

> Is it possible to implement drag&drop of hierarchy items in ImGUI?

Sure, and it actually is very simple. My drag&drop support is probably less than 40 lines long. It goes something like this:

1. Set "drag data" to some global spot, like subsystem driving UI
2. Subsystem renders frameless imgui window at mouse position if there is drag data set and left mouse button is down
3. Widget accepting drop checks if there is drag data set and mouse was released on this frame, if so - gets drag data from the subsystem and uses it, subsystem no longer stores drag data.

For hierarchy it would work the same.

> Does ImGUI support OS files drag&drop?

ImGui itself does not handle drag&drop at all, but we can possibly make it work. Urho3D supports dropping OS files on to window, with coordinates where it is dropped. That is enough to make imgui widgets accept that drop.

> Probably I should move this way.

I want to collaborate. Thing is biggest turndown for contributing to Urho3D is the fact that bundings have to be maintained manually. That is neither fun, nor straightforward at times.. In case of editor that could be less of a problem though.

Eugene | 2017-11-09 13:32:39 UTC | #13

Could I PM you somewhere?
Skype/Gitter/WhatsUp/Slack etc...

-------------------------

rku | 2017-11-09 13:33:25 UTC | #14

im on gitter, in Urho3D room as well. Username is @rokups

-------------------------

Eugene | 2017-11-19 22:10:51 UTC | #15

The Editor is now compatible with main Urho repo.
Could be checked out from https://github.com/rokups/Urho3D-Toolbox

-------------------------

johnnycable | 2017-11-20 09:28:20 UTC | #16

How am I supposed to integrate it with the master? Drag and drop somewhere then cmake and rebuild everything?

-------------------------

rku | 2017-11-20 09:31:12 UTC | #17

You are supposed to build master branch of Urho3D and use it as SDK to build Urho3D-Toolbox. At the moment it is little more than a demo. Do not expect useful tool just yet.

-------------------------

Upgrade the master and copy autoload, data and coredata by hand

-------------------------

rku | 2017-11-20 10:22:27 UTC | #21

@slapin you need latest SDK build.

@johnnycable that part is bit wonky. Build system is supposed to symlink them automatically from `${URHO3D_HOME}/bin` but sometimes that requires to run cmake twice. If it is normal SDK install then yeah you would have to copy over resources. In the future editor should work within your project's resource path instead.

-------------------------

johnnycable | 2017-11-20 10:33:53 UTC | #22

I have a urho3d_home/build/bin/autoload etc. installation. Those are symlink already. It's trying to create the symlink of a symlink, which on Os X results in creating an "symlink name copy" symlink in the original directory, and not in your build/bin...

-------------------------

slapin | 2017-11-20 13:09:58 UTC | #23

I don't know where you got that SDK from but the error is from latest github master build.

Try using engine as SDK without installing it. That is how i am using it. Just set `URHO3D_HOME` to cmake build dir of engine.

Weird. Now that i think of it - not sure why on earth it builds for me with freetype.. Anyhow do this:

1. Remove `imgui_freetype.cpp` from [here](https://github.com/rokups/Urho3D-Toolbox/blob/master/ThirdParty/imgui/CMakeLists.txt#L26)
2. Comment out [this](https://github.com/rokups/Urho3D-Toolbox/blob/master/Toolbox/SystemUI/SystemUI.cpp#L37)
