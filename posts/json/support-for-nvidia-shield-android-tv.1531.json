It is also very limited in use and outdated by a newer version in my private repo, so I cannot provide any support on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is normal behavior for button events to only fire once. That is why they are events. Ideally you would internally track the state of some action, and trigger the action based on input events. Alternatively you can query the Input system yourself to track the input state during each Update.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAxis stuff can get somewhat mucked up across controllers. Some controllers use different axis for different things, including the Xbox 360 controller’s famous triggers (which are both implemented as 1 axis when using DirectInput).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsController() is based on SDL_IsGameController. SDL will mark a joystick as a controller if it has standardized mapped bindings for the controller. These are added via SDL_GameControllerAddMapping, and you can see an example of this in the InputManager example above where I provide bindings for the Xbox 360 controller. If bindings don’t exist, SDL will treat the joystick as a simple generic joystick.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":3,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:08:21.266Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":4,"readers_count":3,"score":0.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":1531,"topic_slug":"support-for-nvidia-shield-android-tv","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://github.com/thebluefish/Urho3D-Misc/tree/master/InputManager","internal":false,"reflection":false,"clicks":1}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":80,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":8800,"name":"","username":"esak","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/e/7ea924/{size}.png","created_at":"2015-12-02T19:16:09.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/thebluefish\"\u003e@thebluefish\u003c/a\u003e: Thanks for the pointer!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI managed to read the current axis and hat values in SceneUpdate-event, using the defined controller-constants.
