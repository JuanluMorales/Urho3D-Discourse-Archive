Hello, I'm trying to make a ragdoll in the editor. Is a constraints OtherBody position/rotation supposed to be what the OtherBody nodes position/rotation are?  If so and the constraint wants world transforms, how do I get the OtherBody nodes world position/rotation in the editor?  If the constraint wants transforms local to its own node, how would I get that from the OtherBody as well?  Thanks for any help.

I still need a way of acquiring the OtherBodys converted transforms within the editor.
