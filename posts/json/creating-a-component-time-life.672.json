No need to special-case or turn off anything in GameObject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder, too, about your use of GameObject to track things such as parent (which can be obtained through the Node interface instead), type (which can be stored in a Node-level user variable if it’s really necessary) or children (which again can be accessed through the Node). Again, this strikes me as a component that is trying to take on too much responsibility. It gets back to the same old mess of polymorphic hierarchies trying to include everything, including the kitchen sink, in order to account for all possible object types; worse, you are deliberately bypassing the wonderful composition framework provided by Urho in order to make it.[/quote]\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":7,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:02:02.628Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":1,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":13,"readers_count":12,"score":2.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":672,"topic_slug":"creating-a-component-time-life","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":88,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":3653,"name":"","username":"vivienneanthony","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/vivienneanthony/{size}/942_2.png","created_at":"2014-12-17T04:36:59.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eDoes this make sense?
