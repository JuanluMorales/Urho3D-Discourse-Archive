We?re releasing the source code for Serious Engine v1.10! It?s the very same engine that we used for Serious Sam Classic: The First Encounter and The Second Encounter.\u003cbr\u003e\n…\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd it?s even better today! Obviously, Serious Engine v1.10 won?t produce top-notch graphics, but the source code is very well commented, easy to modify, and there are lots of user generated mods out there. This version has everything you need to build your own game ? or just experiment.\u003cbr\u003e\n…[/quote]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca
