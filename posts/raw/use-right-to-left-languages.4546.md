I wish I could help you. But apart from changing the [alignment](https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/class_urho3_d_1_1_text.html#a1582bfb8d06d3c7675681ed2475b8756) of `Text` I _don't know_ if Urho (already) has full support for right-to-left languages.
Would it be enough to reverse the order of each string/line as a work-around? Adding this as a parameter shouldn't be too hard. Maybe you could create a pull request for this?

Welcome to the forums, btw! :confetti_ball: :)

Thanks for your sympathy.thanks,I Changed text alignment but dont work.
in editor i cant insert farsi language in text3d.
i think in core editor dose not ready for enter right to left language.
i dont know how to develop urho3d editor to possibility use right to left language.

But would reversing the string before use solve your problem?

Isn't the order of the characters all that needs to change?

@hassanrahimi I think you need Persian Reshaper.
I search and i found one for C#
https://github.com/yeganehaym/PersianReshaper 
I don't know which platform do you using now.

btw write your word in `Character map` and paste it to your code for test.

thanks mr Omid and thanks Mr Modanung 
it's Solved.

for todays, before support RTL languages in Urho3d , Combine two methods 
1: Write your text in Character Map and copy text to string in c#(click start menu and write Charactor Map)
2: reverse your string
3: show in value in text.

```
    protected override void Start()
		{

                     string str = "ïº³ï» ïºŽï»¡ ïº‘ï»ª ï»«ï»¤ï»ª";   
                    var cache = ResourceCache;
                    var helloText = new Text()
              {
                
                Value = Reverse(str),
             
					HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center,
					VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center,                    
                    
				};
			helloText.SetColor(new Color(0f, 1f, 0f));
			helloText.SetFont(font: cache.GetFont("Fonts/BYekan1.sdf"), size: 30);
            
            UI.Root.AddChild(helloText);
            
			
			Graphics.SetWindowIcon(cache.GetImage("Textures/UrhoIcon.png"));
			Graphics.WindowTitle = "UrhoSharp Sample";

			// Subscribe to Esc key:
			Input.SubscribeToKeyDown(args => { if (args.Key == Key.Esc) Exit(); });
		}


//Reverse method
 private static string Reverse(string str)
        {
            string revStr = string.Empty;
            for (int i = str.Length - 1; i >= 0; i--)
            {
                revStr += str[i].ToString();
            }
            return revStr;
        }
```
