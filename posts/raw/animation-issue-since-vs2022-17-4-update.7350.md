Hello, 

Since I have updated Visual Studio 2022 to the latest version (17.4), after compiling my project the animated models animations skinning is completely broken. I have switched back to VS2022 17.3 version and recompiled (without any changes) and everything is working fine again. 

Can anyone else confirm this issue ? 

Thanks :)
