Probably it was because I deleted xcode and set new compiler path. But the compiler should have no relation to this. So I cleaned up all build cache, reset cmake cache and reload project, even restarted the computer. The GetCollisionLayer() still gives all zero for all objects in the scene no matter what value I set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI somehow messed up with cmake version in the process so I also reinstalled the latest version cmake.\u003cbr\u003e\nI also reinstall back the xcode and remove/reinstall the xcode command line tools. Still not working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to doubt if my previous git version really worked so I run \u003ccode\u003egit stash\u003c/code\u003e and build/run the program again. Now the collision layers are correct values!
