Hi guys,

I've just submitted my first bug report for this project (#2232) and I thought it's time to introduce myself.
I've been using this engine for a couple of years now on a hobby project of mine, and I'm quite impress with it's capabilities and friendliness for such a lightweight library.
As for my background, I'm an embedded software engineer, but for a long time I wanted to start my own game project and Urho3D was great help for that.
Thank you so much to all the people that contributed to this great project!

Have a great day!
