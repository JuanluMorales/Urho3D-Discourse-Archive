It’s a cool library with some nice features, first impressions are good. The intrusive ref counting for Urho’s pointers is a bit iffy, but i’ve let it slide \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I’ve been messing around, built some objects and effects, and I have encountered an issue where my ParticleEmitter’s ScenePostUpdate subscription isn’t being found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome context…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirstly, I was building a basic ‘game’ using a class ‘Game’ deriving from Urho3D::Application.\u003cbr\u003e\nMy scene, camera, everything was owned by Game. I built a ParticleEmitter, added it to a node which was a child of the scene and everything worked fine. I had a lovely torch like effect in my game!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter some time I found that I was going to want multiple scenes, and was going to have them all inside the Game::Start() function which is called by the Engine. This wasn’t what I wanted, I want all scenes in a separate class so they can be switched between easily, whilst keeping my project clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy solution to this was to create a new class ‘World’ deriving from Urho3D::Object.\u003cbr\u003e\nI structured this class virtually the same as how ‘Game’ was structured. It had a World::Start() function which was called inside Game::Start() which initialises all the same things that Game::Start() used to ( scene, camera, boxes, particleEmitter). However, now the event subscriptions were being setup through scene_-\u0026gt;SubscribeToEvent() rather than just SubscribeToEvent(). ( This had something to do with ‘Game’ using the member function of its derived class ‘Object’ while my new class ‘World’ wouldn’t let me do that.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe end result of this transition was the paticleEmitter not showing on my screen. That was the only thing that had broken. I have tired a lot of different things to fix this with no result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter some debugging I think I tracked the bug down to the ParticleEmitter’s subscription not being called correctly (ScenePostUpdate) OR the subscription itself isn’t being setup correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny advice/help would be very helpful. Also, if anyone has any solutions to the issue of how to store scenes so they can be activated like modules that would be great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEDIT: It wasn’t Context::SubscribeToEvent it was Scene::SubscribeToEvent\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex!!\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2018-10-22T17:57:37.647Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":2,"reads":28,"readers_count":27,"score":15.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":4611,"topic_slug":"particle-emitters-scenepostupdate-not-being-found","display_username":"Alex Hodges","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":2,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1062,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":26282,"name":"魔大农 𝞍𝞎𝝳 現招蜍","username":"Modanung","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/modanung/{size}/3290_2.png","created_at":"2018-10-22T17:33:28.918Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eI cannot find this \u003ccode\u003eContext::SubscribeToEvent\u003c/code\u003e method and your \u003ccode\u003eWorld\u003c/code\u003e class \u003cem\u003eshould\u003c/em\u003e inherit it.
