Agents are part of a crowd (CrowdManager).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy problem is - the higher the max speed, \u003cstrong\u003ethe more the agent wobbles around the final target\u003c/strong\u003e, going back and forth until it stops.

(SetMaxAccel) - but it only goes so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve found that max speed 30 and max accel ~800 will result in instant stoppage at the final target.
