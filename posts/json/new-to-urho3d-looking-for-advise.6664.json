It’s centered more around the library rather than the editor and I believe that is what makes it give faster results as it never tries to slow you down.\u003cbr\u003e\nI’d say that 99% of everything you’ll ever ask may have been asked before in the forum archives, but don’t hesitate to ask here if you feel lost. There’s a terrain editor and a nice skeleton constraint editor made by the people here that are worth looking at.\u003cbr\u003e\nLearn how to use attributes and events in Urho3D efficiently. Attributes are really nice as everything uses them and you can animate them quickly and integrate any variable into the editor with 1 macro + get/set functions. Events are really powerful and you can let components communicate with each other with little setup (despite the risk of code spaghetti).\u003cbr\u003e\nThe engine is completely usable without the editor, but learning to use it is very worthwhile especially if you plan to work with UI.\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd grab a copy from master branch, not the 1.7 release!\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2021-01-16T19:31:55.145Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":44,"readers_count":43,"score":28.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":6664,"topic_slug":"new-to-urho3d-looking-for-advise","display_username":"Actually Permanent","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":2,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"","bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":1}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1165,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":41556,"name":"","username":"JSandusky","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/jsandusky/{size}/3220_2.png","created_at":"2021-01-18T05:51:30.265Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eMake yourself aware of API limits and how Urho uses those limited things. From my own experience blowing the D3D11 SamplerState limit before with scores of tiny 16x16 textures before I fixed it as a table in a fork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eView, Renderer, and RenderPath are your danger-zone classes. Everything you touch there is likely to have serious consequences or balloon in the scale of changes required beyond what you might imagine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCode search for the \u003ccode\u003eWorkQueue\u003c/code\u003e so you know what’s already jobified so you don’t do something stupid trying to jobify things that are already jobified in some fashion elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalance your script and C++ code usage. Some tasks like those that touch crowds and physics events are better suited for C++ than Angelscript/Lua.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a handy-dandy \u003ccode\u003eWriteDrawablesToOBJ\u003c/code\u003e capability that you can use to dump your scene/geometries to OBJ so you can use it as a reference in other tools (or for other purposes like static-batching). This is useful when you need to generate geometry in other tools like Houdini or just fitting some spline generated extrusions in Blender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeware that the async loading is actually brittle as hell. If there’s a pending async load you have to force it to finish before queueing a new async load. You can quickly tweak that to pump asyncs into a vector though and cycle through them for each step of the async load. If you intend to use async load, then you \u003cstrong\u003eMUST\u003c/strong\u003e modify the function to accept a destination Node. It’s borderline unusable without it as you can’t dump async things out if you don’t have a holder for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: Urho is also not setup for texture streaming. If you need that you need setup your own file scheme for how you load mips from bottom to top instead of the usual top to bottom and setup the sampler LODs appropriately to cap the miplevel.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":3,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2021-01-18T05:59:41.004Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":42,"readers_count":41,"score":88.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":6664,"topic_slug":"new-to-urho3d-looking-for-advise","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":2,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":5}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1358,"hidden":false,"trust_level":0,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"user_suspended":true,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":41568,"name":null,"username":"talos","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/t/a6a055/{size}.png","created_at":"2021-01-22T03:25:56.881Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThank you a lot for your amazing answer.
