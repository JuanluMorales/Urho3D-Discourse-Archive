Hello i'm new to this world of programming. I'm struggling to make the character from de samples to climb stair, i tried to increase the gravity, lower it, but still. I'm thinking of doing a raycast on the front of the player and checking the angle, and them modifing the "move_velocity" vector to that direction, and i'm failing hard. Can someone show me how to implement this on this engine? Thanks.
