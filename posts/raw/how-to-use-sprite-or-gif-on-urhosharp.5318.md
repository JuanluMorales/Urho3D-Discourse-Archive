Can someone explain or show to me any sample code where sprite or gif is used?

Hi!
I would love to help you!
Unfortunately, you said "urho sharp" in your post title.
This space deals with the urho engine framework, while urho sharp is a splinter project, a fork, which we can't (or won't) provide help with. At least for me personally, it is because I have no idea, I do not use that fork. I am not going to start on the political implications but I will state clearly that this is not the urho sharp forum, that you might restate your question, and that I do wish you well in your search for the answer to your question.
