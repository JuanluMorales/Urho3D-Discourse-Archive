Obligatory, lol.

Funny thing is that a Flappy Birds clone is the flagship game of Unreal Engine 4.
UE4 was released in May 2012, and its Unreal Tournament game is still in pre-alpha.

The code seems like a nice example of how to do things too. Thanks for sharing!
I'm considering a fork featuring [url=http://luckeyproductions.nl/B4W/urho.html]Urho[/url]. :slight_smile:

Added seaweed and bubble digits. Also the highest score is saved to (and loaded from) a file, beating the highscore is rewarded with a crown as well as being pronounced _**king of the deep**_.

I had my siblings over today. My two-year-old nephew had some great fun with Flappy Urho. Although he couldn't get past the first net he kept saying "Wieder!" - which means _again_ in German - and restarting the game. :slight_smile:
It was the first computer game he ever played!
