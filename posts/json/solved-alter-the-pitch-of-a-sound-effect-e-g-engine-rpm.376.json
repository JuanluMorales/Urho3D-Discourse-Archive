I will then mix between these sounds to to match the engine RPM. But ideally I would also like to alter the pitch up/down of each sample when they overlap, e.g. at 1500 RPMs. At 1500 RPMs there are two effects playing - the 1000 and 2000 RPM sounds, but I would like to alter the pitch of these slightly based on the current vehicle engine load. So my question is really - is it possible to alter the pitch (or speed) of a sample using SDL? I have done this previously with OpenAL which allowed me to alter the pitch of a sound directly, but from what I see SDL has no such feature. Does anybody know if this is possible with SDL, or will I need to implement the audio using OpenAL?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a branch that has simple OpenAL playback implemented here: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/boberfly/Urho3D/tree/openal\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003egithub.com/boberfly/Urho3D/tree/openal\u003c/a\u003e and this works well, although it‚Äôs missing music streaming.
