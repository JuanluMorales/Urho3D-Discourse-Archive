Hello guys, what do you use for data mgmt? I mean, for storing large artifacts like big mdl and ani and textures and so on.
I'm looking for tools, and I'm asking myself if I should stick with s.t. like [git lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) or use [subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/) or something more pro (if convenient) like [perforce](https://www.perforce.com/).
What are you using?
