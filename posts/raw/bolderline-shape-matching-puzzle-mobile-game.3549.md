Very simple aesthetic, but executed well !

I've seen a few other Urho projects that were equally simple in aesthetic, but could take note of the difference a pleasing colour palette can make.

It's a slow progress. Had a thought to abandon this game. But, at beginning of this year, I decided to continue this game. Almost 90% complete. Hope I can release it this month.

Hey guys, 

Finally I've just released this game on Google Play. I decided to release it in beta first to get some feedback & suggestions.

Finally, I made it to full release. So far, I haven't got any technical report from testers. I'm satisfied with Urho3D stability. It's a bit challenging to integrate Google Play Service, IAP, & Admob, but I'm managed to do it. :slight_smile:

I really like it but it's extremely hard :D Maybe you should make the elements falling slower , use landscape mode (i found it really inconvenient holding the phone with one hand and moving my thumb at the same time).Also i think  the complex shapes and the padlocks show up too early and ruins the gameplay too quickly.

Otherwise the gameplay/graphics/sound are 10/10 !
