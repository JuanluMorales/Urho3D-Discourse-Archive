Hello friends of the fish.  After many hours thing shaped up enough to share with everyone.

[github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/307](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/307)

I would love some good feedback.  It is missing some integrations I am sure.  Hopefully this is up to the quality Urho deserves and can serve as a platform for managing resources more effectively.
