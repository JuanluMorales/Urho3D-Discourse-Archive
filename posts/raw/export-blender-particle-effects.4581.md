I can export models and animations from Blender just fine. What about its particle effects? Can I export them to Urho XML format somehow?

Nope. Their logic is completely different. Best edit the effects in the Urho editor or have a look at the [SPARK](https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/spark-particle-engine-renderer/3670) integration for more advanced effects.
