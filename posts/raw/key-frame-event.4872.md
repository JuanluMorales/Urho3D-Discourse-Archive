Is there a way to set an event when a certain key-frame number is reached in an animation? For example a melee animation that has 45 frames. Is there a way to maybe call a function or trigger something when it hits lets say frame 38. C++ please no script.

Read the "Animation triggers" part

If you're using Blender, the [exporter](https://github.com/reattiva/Urho3D-Blender) has an _Export markers as triggers_ option.
