Bullet objects have a “userpointer” which is often used for this purpose, but I don’t think we’re setting it - this means there is no way to, for example, obtain the Name of an object involved in a collision, because we can’t get hold of any Urho objects from within a collision callback - therefore we can’t get to the parent Node to query its name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[EDIT]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrho’s RigidBody class has no GetCollisionShape method - given an urho rb, we have to query the parent node for the CollisionShape component (which we assume is attached to the same node as the body).
