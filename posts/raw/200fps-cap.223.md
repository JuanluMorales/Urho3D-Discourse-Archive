Hello all.
I'm starting to learn this beautiful engine for few days.
Hail all the devs team.  :slight_smile: 

Simple question, why I'm always getting 200 fps at very simple scene if I turned off v-sync? Is that supposed behavior?

Welcome to our forum.

The maximum FPS is capped at 200. The max and min FPS can be set using Engine class.

Thanks for the answer.
If I set max fps to 9999, I got about ~1500fps. Wow!  :astonished:
