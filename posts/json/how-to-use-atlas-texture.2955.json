I would suggest seeing if you can to it with an array texture, add I think that should have the same benefits you want. Preferably someone else has a suggestion, as I’ve wanted to do the same thing, but haven’t thought of a way to do it (nor had the will to sit down and try).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will say, you likely have to multiply the original UV cord by 0.5 first.
