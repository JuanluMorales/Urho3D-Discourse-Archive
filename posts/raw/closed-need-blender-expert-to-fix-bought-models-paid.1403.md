Hello, I've bought some models and they came in several formats including fbx.  When I import in blender however, rotations may be odd or positions may be offset, textures may be missing, etc (not game-ready).  I need a blender expert to make the characters models and their animations, urho-friendly.  Any interested parties please quote prices.
