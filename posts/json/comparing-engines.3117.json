But a lot of hype and drive.<br>\nMost people are aside and say how cool Godot is but never tried to make anything beyond simplest.<br>\nAlso very toxic community (probably it is common with gamedev, just depends on number of people) which will attack you if you try to indicate some bugs. Also Reduz wants to make everything himself.<br>\nIf you want to add a feature and he do not have it planned, or wants to make himself some time in future he won\u2019t accept your PR.<br>\nBut there are no much public plans.

Also if somebody thinks I personally offended somebody, that is their own problem as I might be not even aware of that.</span><br>\nIn general what was frustrating most is that if you found a bug and report it the first reaction you get is \u201cnobody complained yet\u201d and over time it happens nobody used that cool feature. So when you\u2019re always blamed for your bugs that is not really good so you stop reporting them and stop caring. After some time working with Godot you know - if that is not in demo using specially prepared assets then it doesn\u2019t work, you don\u2019t even need to waste time trying it even if it is advertised feature. Also constant happiness of community about Godot annoyed me too much. And if you show people obvious bugs they won\u2019t believe you, but they eventually get hit by them, in months,<br>\nand as I seen that my old reports get some discussion. I got sick of it. Most people who had enough knowledge, struggled a bit and gone quickly, I was optimist for too long, then my frustration finally overpowered my stupid loyalty.<br>\nSo I started looking at alternatives. With Ogre you get nice game engine constructor, but that was too<br>\nhard for me, as I don\u2019t have any gamedev experience. I was pointed to Urho3D at Godot IRC channel by<br>\nuser Calinou and I was not happy at first, but after some frustrating hours with Godot I tried Urho<br>\nespecially examples and was very happy. Also examples were very transparent, so not made look good<br>\nusing some trickery, everything is there to take and try. I was not too happy about Mixamo models with uncertain status, but I did not need them.<br>\nI quickly got some progress with simple things with Urho, made some people hate me in progress, but<br>\nthe ends justify means. The community is very small and it is very hard to get information. Also<br>\nas I lack gamedev experience I often don\u2019t know the right question. I could go for Unity which have<br>\nmuch more information and features, but I want to be with Open Source.stuff. So now I\u2019m more or less<br>\nhappy with my toys. It is a lot to be done to gain some experience with basic game making, but I can say<br>\nI more or less can do most of things I want with enough effort without much problems stopping me.<br>\nSo I could say that while time spent fighting with godot was not complete waste of time, I could use it more effectively learning new things and making fun stuff using Urho.</p>", "post_number": 2, "post_type": 1, "updated_at": "2017-05-12T00:20:27.288Z", "reply_count": 1, "reply_to_post_number": 1, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 11, "reads": 121, "readers_count": 120, "score": 99.2, "yours": false, "topic_id": 3117, "topic_slug": "comparing-engines", "display_username": "", "primary_group_name": null, "flair_name": null, "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": null, "flair_color": null, "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": true, "user_title": null, "reply_to_user": {"username": "johnnycable", "name": "kabu", "avatar_template": "/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/johnnycable/{size}/788_2.png"}, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [{"id": 2, "count": 1}], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 554, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 2, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false}, {"id": 17770, "name": "kabu", "username": "johnnycable", "avatar_template": "/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/johnnycable/{size}/788_2.png", "created_at": "2017-05-12T11:57:19.433Z", "cooked": "<p>My take, if you don\u2019t mind.<br>\nI\u2019ve come here from cocos2dx, because it is left 4 dead by the company, a shame.

(I want a city sandbox with using procedural generation, with all buildings enter-able, but simple enough to accomplish by 1 person in several years) It is very technically challenging, but it is fun and motivating. And Urho lacks on almost all aspects I need so the road is very far from forming. I even can\u2019t establish proper asset pipeline for characters with quality I need. The good thing is \u201cyou got what you have\u201d approach, so if you need some stuff, write it and that will work.<br>\nThe problem of course is lack of knowledge on how things work in game engines and lack of public information and<br>\nthat it is often costs thousands of $$$ which is quite expensive for hobby projects. It is great there are people who do challenging tasks like IK, but there are many things which are needed to be done yet to at least have all code frameworks done. But with Urho it is easy to do planning, it is easy to assume that you write everything you need yourself. If you think something you code might be accepted to core engine, you can submit PR and get some feedback. So my current problem is lack of knowledge on how to do some specific  features, but that is slowly progressing. Again, I could go for Unity which does have tutorial on almost everything and addons for the rest,<br>\nbut that will get my hobby project depending on closed tool which will not let me run it on ARM Linux for example, so I would lose a lot of comfort. Also I won\u2019t be able to call this open source anymore.<br>\nBy saying that I need to tell that every tool have its downsides. For my case Urho currently have less, in addition to<br>\nthe fact I spent enough time learning it so I can foresee solutions for all my problems.
