Hi!

It's been on my mind for a while now and I just wanted to let you all know that I have decided to leave Urho. I haven't really been active for the past few months anyway.
It has been a pleasure to work for and with it, have learned a lot but I'm afraid this is where my Urho journey ends. Will check the forums once in a while tho.

There are a few things that I've started to build in the engine but didn't finish:
[P2P suport](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/tree/websockets-implementation)
[Websockets support](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/tree/websockets-implementation)
Emscripten shell tweaks (mouse handling, proper DPI handling for canvas size)
And any other project outside the engine core that I've started

If anyone wants to take over them, feel free to do that. I can provide any additional information if needed.
