You can find my latest (non code breaking, so far!) changes, all here.

500 additions and 100 removals hardly count as a "remaster" to be honest. Half of it just a switch in the script component.

Not bashing on anything. Just calling it what it is.

I start where I started - the list of issues is huge, so far I just hit the ones that get in my face.
Given that the usual PR route was not working out for me, I created a whole new fork, so at least I have something to link back to.

The number of changes of code in terms of code points, or lines, or whatever, is really never relevant to making positive change... I don't think we should measure progress in these terms.
Given nobody was making advances in public, I chose to. This makes me somewhat of a target, given that I am relatively new around here, but it does not mean I am incapable of improving the status quo!

Why not just add branches to your fork without changing the name?  
And if you _do_ insist on changing the name, may I suggest: [**Lathe** Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lathe)? It does fast cycles. :wink:
Also: [spoiler]`lasse & leith == lathe`[/spoiler]

In the mean time we will stick with master till it dies. I might die before it does :slight_smile:

George, I plan to push changes periodically from my repo back to the master, but I won't piecemeal issue pr for each issue anymore

Modanung - my FireStorm engine had a more efficient approach to event delivery, and was otherwise very similar, including subsystems, components, and so on. I will consider opening the source for public derision, so we can pick out any good parts, and laugh at any bad parts, together.
Oh that's right, I already sent you source for FS2, as part of the gpu accelerated neural ai for games thing

Oh, Modanung, I can code lathe paths in G codes, if you want to insinuate I am a knob, do so, I can code a knob and make it out of anything I care to put in the jaws of my lathe

-------------------------

Modanung | 2019-08-31 21:00:23 UTC | #11

The logo does not represent a knob, but rather a [pawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawn_(chess)): The game piece most commonly spun on a lathe.

This is a technical forum and we only need people who makes positive contributions or asking the right questions. Not a place for troll.
