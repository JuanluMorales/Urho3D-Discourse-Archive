I have the following : A player. The player is a model with a rigidbody and a collision shape.\u003cbr\u003e\n: 4 Walls, a floor \u0026amp; ceiling, each with rigidbodies and collisionshapes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuestion: How do I stop the player from being able to pass through the walls/floor/ceiling? I can do the simple method to check if they‚Äôre out of bounds and then change their position back but that isn‚Äôt as fluid and doesn‚Äôt work perfectly sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I remember correctly, In Unity it was possible to alter the Rigidbodies somehow, and it would cause the body to stop as soon as it hits another one. I was wondering if it was possible in Urho too.\u003cbr\u003e\nI played around with rigidbodies a slight bit and a way for me to stop going through walls but as soon as I touch another rigidbody, it applies a force to my player that causes them to float away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany thanks for the help!\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2018-01-07T04:50:09.809Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":2,"reads":32,"readers_count":31,"score":18.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":3919,"topic_slug":"prevent-passing-through-objects","display_username":"David","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":868,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":22773,"name":"Trevor Cash","username":"TrevorCash","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/trevorcash/{size}/698_2.png","created_at":"2018-01-07T05:40:58.334Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eSample 18 has a custom component called ‚ÄúCharacter‚Äù that handles the interactions for a player:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003caside class=\"onebox whitelistedgeneric\"\u003e\n  \u003cheader class=\"source\"\u003e\n      \u003cimg src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicon.ico\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\"\u003e\n      \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/tree/master/Source/Samples/18_CharacterDemo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eGitHub\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/header\u003e\n  \u003carticle class=\"onebox-body\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/1X/e5b6b364c13e5c4bcba6bdb4edef78bcf160a9a2.png\" class=\"thumbnail onebox-avatar\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\"\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/tree/master/Source/Samples/18_CharacterDemo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eurho3d/Urho3D\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCross-platform 2D and 3D game engine.
