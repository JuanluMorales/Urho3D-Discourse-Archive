okay i suppose urho3d can be compiled with ndk,sdk and tools to generate android and ios, but what about the android and ios releases? 

https://urho3d.github.io/releases/2017/08/19/urho3d-1.7-release.html

can i generate a apk or app directly from them?
i need to have just ndk and tools / xcode?
or these releases are just a "test"/"trash"?

Those releases are SDKs. You develop your project just like any other c++ project for ios/android and link to a SDK of that platform.
