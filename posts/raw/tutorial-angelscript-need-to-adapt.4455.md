Just find this: https://wiki.frictionalgames.com/hpl3/community/scripting/angelscript_tutorial

Is a angelscript tutorial for the frictional engine (amnesia's engine, terror game).
I know that this tutorial is adapted to the frictional engine, but it explains how angelscripts works (not in the hard way like in the docs), just need read the urho3d docs to understand better the Urho3D and adapt to it (MAYBE, i think).

If the download pdf button won't work, u can use this: https://pdfmyurl.com/
Put the url and download it.

Guys, correct me if i wrong, please. Ok? Thanks! ^^

n sry for my english if i wrote something wrong xD
