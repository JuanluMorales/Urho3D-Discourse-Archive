Hello, I'm making a tiny horror game and it needs a writer for dialogue, as well as voice actors (1 female, 1 male).  The male actor needs to have a British accent and the female an Asian accent.  Volunteers and interested parties please post portfolios.  I'm planning on distributing on android for $1 (payment is negotiable, be it rev-share or upfront).  Thanks for your time.
