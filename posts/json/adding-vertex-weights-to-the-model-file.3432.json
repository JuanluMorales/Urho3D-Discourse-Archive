To achieve this, I found I need to be able to get the vertex weight values from weight groups, so that vertices can be marked as immobile, or affected by soft body physics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI briefly thought about saving this data to separate weight files, but discarded the idea as it’s a recipe for easy desynchronization. As such, I decided that this data should be saved in the model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently I’m appending the vertex weight data file with a block formatted like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e   'WGHT' - 4 byte identifier of the block\n   block size - UInt the number of bytes in the block (not including the identifier and block size)\n   vertex group count - UInt The number of vertex groups contained in this block.\n   vertex group list - A list of Vertex Groups, with the format detailed just below.\n\nVertex Groups:\n   vertex group name - C string name of the group.\n   index size - UInt Number of bytes in an index (2 or 4).\n   vertex count - UInt\n   vertex weight list - A list of Vertex Weights, with format detailed just below.\n\nVertex Weights:\n   vertex index - UShort or UInt The index of the vert\n   weight - float A float in the range of 0.0 to 1.0 with the weight of the vertex.\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far it’s working fine, but I’m not sure if this is the best way to add this feature into the Urho3D model file.

If the original model had more than 4 bones affecting a vertex, it would keep the 4 with the largest weights, and discard everything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could certainly abuse the bone weight list by adding phantom bones or using special weight values, and ignoring the summing to 1 rule. However, that will involve rejigging the model loader to handle the special cases, and creating models that might behave badly if loaded into other Urho3D software that lack the rejigged loader. Additionally it would have a limit of 4 vertex groups for normally boneless models, and lower for models that use actual bones.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":4,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-08-09T08:51:57.389Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":3,"quote_count":1,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":21,"readers_count":20,"score":9.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":3432,"topic_slug":"adding-vertex-weights-to-the-model-file","display_username":"Xenodora","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"reply_to_user":{"username":"Modanung","name":"魔大农 𝞍𝞎𝝳 現招蜍","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/modanung/{size}/3290_2.png"},"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":793,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":20025,"name":"SirNate0","username":"SirNate0","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/9f8e36/{size}.png","created_at":"2017-08-09T19:33:40.745Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eI don’t know if the mdl file supports it, but I think you can declare somewhat arbitrary vertex semantics that would let you add the weights (I’ve never messed with it myself, though).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003caside class=\"onebox whitelistedgeneric\"\u003e\n  \u003cheader class=\"source\"\u003e\n      \u003ca href=\"https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.6/_vertex_buffers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eUrho3D\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/header\u003e\n  \u003carticle class=\"onebox-body\"\u003e\n    \n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.6/_vertex_buffers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eVertex buffers\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUrho3D is a free lightweight, cross-platform 2D and 3D game engine implemented in C++ and released under the MIT license.
