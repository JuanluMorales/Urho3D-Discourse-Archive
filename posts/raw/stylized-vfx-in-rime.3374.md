I subscribe to this guy and he often comes out with interesting videos - he came out with this recently:

If you liked that video, Simon also provided a link to Blizzard's Diablo VFX video on his page -

Just watching these two vids pushed my VFX knowledge by years. And finally learning how to do:

I guess I was the only newb to VFX who just discovered how to uv map a circle in such way to produce the effect shown in the above gif.

For other newbs like myself, here's how:

Scrolling UV:
1) from C -> A, produces effect shown in the gif
2) from A -> C, shrinking effect
3) up or down - spiral effect

Interesting concept indeed.

As a sphere (three "planes"):

Your texture on the flat circle is very interesting. I bet you can shape the circle like a fountain and it'll be a perfect fountain.  The tri-planar sphere is too abstract to know what's going on, though - on 2nd look, it could be a lightning ball!

Both are meant to be lightning spell effects. :slight_smile:
I plan to use them for [KO](https://github.com/LucKeyProductions/KO).

If anyone else has worked on this and would like to compare notes, email me.

In case some of you are interested in the particle count:
- green poison - 15
- rime fire - 1
- pink buff - 15
- fire - 20
