Basically I have a stack of game states, such as Main menu -\u0026gt; World menu -\u0026gt; Game -\u0026gt; Options. Each state is just put on top of each other, like in general way of doing game states. Then I pass the so called global events only to the top most state, like handling esc-press only the top most component would have access to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe UI I was thinking of handing in a way where I have only one UI, but each state has its own UIElement, and disenable on state changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScenes I was thinking of doing the same way, where each state has its own node-component that is set onto root scene, and they only control the state of their own node. When state is changed then the node might be disenabled. I guess it depends on the game, but for what I was planning there is no need to update the state of the game when being in menus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost likely there are a lot of flaws in this, but to my understanding this is a common way of handling multiple states.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":3,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:04:14.241Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":11,"readers_count":10,"score":2.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":937,"topic_slug":"scene-level-events","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":205,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":5405,"name":"","username":"thebluefish","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/t/f04885/{size}.png","created_at":"2015-03-16T20:12:55.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThat’s a common way, but not my preferred way. My state manager works off of the idea that states should be created/destroyed as needed. A MenuState is only present when I need to display the Main Menu, and similarly a GameState is only present when playing the game (and handles its own pause menu). I use a custom UIState class to handle UI “prefabs” that manage their own logic, and can be simply loaded/switched as necessary within a State.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe component idea is weird, and I’m not sure what benefit it allows. You can pause a scene while handling logic in your state, and ideally there would be a different scene for each state.
