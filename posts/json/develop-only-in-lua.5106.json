It is viable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my experience, the AngelScript side of things is tighter and probably superior to the Lua side, as there are still some \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/649\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eissues\u003c/a\u003e with Lua garbage collection that are intrinsic to using tolua++ to generate the bindings. Some care needs to be used when using Lua; ie, avoid generating Urho3D object garbage inside large range loops, or explicitly calling collectgarbage() at intervals inside those loops to clear out garbage before it accumulates. Where this has bitten me in the ass before has been double-nested loops iterating on images and generating Color garbage, and double-nested loops iterating on a tile map and generating Vector3 garbage. The issue manifests as increasing time spent in garbage collection every cycle, as the GC iterates large internal tables, and if allowed to grow large enough it can severely reduce framerate and cause tangible hitches or hiccups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo circumvent issues like this, it is best to limit the amount of Lua object garbage you generate in a frame. My solution was to implement the ‘heavy’ routines (procedural level generation tasks, iterating tilemaps or images, etc…) as C++ routines exposed to Lua script so that they don’t generate 65k temporary objects all in one whack to choke the GC. (This is probably a good idea anyway, even without the GC issue, to keep performance of these tasks as tight as possible.)\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":4,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2019-04-17T09:29:21.372Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":40,"readers_count":39,"score":53.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":5106,"topic_slug":"develop-only-in-lua","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/issues/649","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Lua:
