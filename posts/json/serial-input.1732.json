CodingMonkey is correct that Urho3D only support maximum 32 bones per model for Raspberry Pi platform. Other platforms at least have double that number. To answer your other questions. I don’t think there is a need to rebuild (read customize) the game engine to have a custom serial input class, but that certainly is one way to go. For fast prototyping, I think you can just code in your application to override its main loop to read from a serial port in a non-blocking mode. i.e. reading serial port in between frame rendering. You should be able to find how to read a serial port using C/C++ easily on the web. And since Pi is so cheap and Urho3D supports client/server setup out of the box, probably you may consider to use two Pis per puppeteer and have them work in a client/server mode. The server connected with HDMI cable to TV set while the client connected with a serial controller and a Wifi USB double. Voila, untethered.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":4,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:09:47.004Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":1,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":4,"readers_count":3,"score":0.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":1732,"topic_slug":"serial-input","display_username":"Yao
