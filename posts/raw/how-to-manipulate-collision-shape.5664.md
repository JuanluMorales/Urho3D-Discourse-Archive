Is there a way, in the Urho built-in editor, to customize the collision shape for objects? Like scaling, increasing in X, or Y, etc?

Or should I be doing the collision shapes as some sort of special layer in Blender?

The following functions of the `CollisionShape` allow you to set its position, rotation and/or scale:
```
/// Set as a box.
void SetBox(const Vector3& size, const Vector3& position = Vector3::ZERO, const Quaternion& rotation = Quaternion::IDENTITY);
/// Set as a sphere.
void SetSphere(float diameter, const Vector3& position = Vector3::ZERO, const Quaternion& rotation = Quaternion::IDENTITY);
/// Set as a static plane.
void SetStaticPlane(const Vector3& position = Vector3::ZERO, const Quaternion& rotation = Quaternion::IDENTITY);
/// Set as a cylinder.
void SetCylinder(float diameter, float height, const Vector3& position = Vector3::ZERO, const Quaternion& rotation = Quaternion::IDENTITY);
/// Set as a capsule.
void SetCapsule(float diameter, float height, const Vector3& position = Vector3::ZERO, const Quaternion& rotation = Quaternion::IDENTITY);
/// Set as a cone.
void SetCone(float diameter, float height, const Vector3& position = Vector3::ZERO, const Quaternion& rotation = Quaternion::IDENTITY);
/// Set as a triangle mesh from Model. If you update a model's geometry and want to reapply the shape, call physicsWorld->RemoveCachedGeometry(model) first.
void SetTriangleMesh(Model* model, unsigned lodLevel = 0, const Vector3& scale = Vector3::ONE, const Vector3& position = Vector3::ZERO,
    const Quaternion& rotation = Quaternion::IDENTITY);
/// Set as a triangle mesh from CustomGeometry.
void SetCustomTriangleMesh(CustomGeometry* custom, const Vector3& scale = Vector3::ONE, const Vector3& position = Vector3::ZERO,
    const Quaternion& rotation = Quaternion::IDENTITY);
/// Set as a convex hull from Model.
void SetConvexHull(Model* model, unsigned lodLevel = 0, const Vector3& scale = Vector3::ONE, const Vector3& position = Vector3::ZERO,
    const Quaternion& rotation = Quaternion::IDENTITY);
/// Set as a convex hull from CustomGeometry.
void SetCustomConvexHull(CustomGeometry* custom, const Vector3& scale = Vector3::ONE, const Vector3& position = Vector3::ZERO,
    const Quaternion& rotation = Quaternion::IDENTITY);
/// Set as a triangle mesh from Model. If you update a model's geometry and want to reapply the shape, call physicsWorld->RemoveCachedGeometry(model) first.
void SetGImpactMesh(Model* model, unsigned lodLevel = 0, const Vector3& scale = Vector3::ONE, const Vector3& position = Vector3::ZERO,
    const Quaternion& rotation = Quaternion::IDENTITY);
/// Set as a triangle mesh from CustomGeometry.
void SetCustomGImpactMesh(CustomGeometry* custom, const Vector3& scale = Vector3::ONE, const Vector3& position = Vector3::ZERO,
    const Quaternion& rotation = Quaternion::IDENTITY);
/// Set as a terrain. Only works if the same scene node contains a Terrain component.
void SetTerrain(unsigned lodLevel = 0);
/// Set shape type.
void SetShapeType(ShapeType type);
/// Set shape size.
void SetSize(const Vector3& size);
/// Set offset position.
void SetPosition(const Vector3& position);
/// Set offset rotation.
void SetRotation(const Quaternion& rotation);
/// Set offset transform.
void SetTransform(const Vector3& position, const Quaternion& rotation);
```

I don't know about exporting these from Blender, but the Urho Editor can be used to create prefabs - or extend them - with collision shapes.

I noticed the convex hull doesn't seem to take size into account. Whereas triangle meshes use the size as scale.

To the question of whether you can do it in the editor, if you didnâ€™t find a way to do it, you most likely cannot.
