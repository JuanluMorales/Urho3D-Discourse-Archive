In 3d max I didnt center the object, but i want in Urho to be able to rotate on the object’s center. I tried in 3d max to change the pivot and it works in the program but after exporting, the pivot resets to the center. I tried in Urho with SetGeometry Center but that didnt seems to work, also tried to translate the object back to origin, rotate and the translate it back to the position.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:07:29.493Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":115,"reads":8,"readers_count":7,"score":576.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":1398,"topic_slug":"rotation-center","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":322,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":8050,"name":"","username":"TikariSakari","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/t/f4b2a3/{size}.png","created_at":"2015-10-01T12:43:06.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eYou can add a node to your object, and put offset to the node.
