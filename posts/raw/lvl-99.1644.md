A small project to load maps, player and npcs through script.  In this initial release, a cave, first person camera and spider are showcased.  Linux native for now, when I get past the android issues I'll release on that.

Being trapped in a cave with a giant, hissing spider would be someone's nightmare!  Looking good and scary!

The rock looks floaty, though. It doesn't look like it's falling fast enough. And you might want to add some spiderwebs to enhance the scene.

Looking forward to see what you do with this.

I like how the player falls over on death. Making it happen a tad bit faster would maybe improve it.
Throwing rocks like that reminds me of [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonekeep]Stonekeep[/url]. I loved that game's atmosphere, very immersive audio along with great graphics for its time. Some monsters' graphics are photo sequences of dressed up actors, which I think are really well done. You might want to try it if you haven't already.
