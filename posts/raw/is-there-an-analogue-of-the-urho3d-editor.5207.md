Is there an analogue of the urho3d editor?

A completely unfair answer.

You have some choices.
You can create some stuff in code, and load some other stuff from xml.
You can edit them both, but ultimately, you realize that making stuff in code is bad.
So you move to a data-driven approach, where you load stuff, presumably, but not strictly, from xml.

Are you looking for a game editor, or a way to add editing functions to your game?
