In our build system the PCH refers to “precompiled header”. When the PCH is on, we instructs CMake to execute a compilation process early on using all the gathered compiler flags and compiler defines that would have been used in your build later. If you have a problem in this early test then you probably would get the same problem too later in your build (even when you bypass the problem by setting URHO3D_PCH=0. The use case of this option is very specific when you really want to turn off the precompiled header support. It is not to be used to bypass problem not related to precompiled-header, as you have found out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, back to your problem. If you are building natively on the RPI device itself then upgrade your GCC installation to the latest version you can find in your distro’s repository. The root cause of your error is this line:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou need to find a GCC version that understands this compiler flag: -mcpu=cortex-a7. If you can’t upgrade for some reasons then you can fallback by using this build option when calling cmake_rpi.sh: -DRPI_ABI=armeabi-v6. This will force the build system to fallback to use -mcpu=arm1176jzf-s (i.e. RPI 1).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same applies when you are cross-compiling. If you use the download sources recommended by our documentation page here (\u003ca href=\"http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_building.html#Building_RaspberryPi\"\u003eurho3d.github.io/documentation/H … aspberryPi\u003c/a\u003e) then you should be fine. This combination of cross-compiling toolchain and RPI sysroot has been tested continuously in our CI build. Those RPI software packages that you downloaded from \u003ca href=\"http://sf.net\"\u003esf.net\u003c/a\u003e are in fact just build artifacts from those CI builds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for those glitches. I have no idea on the mouse cursor glitch. I have not seen it yet but I only have RPI 1 to play with. The glitch with the character model skinning is a known issue. The GPUs on RPI 1 and 2 are the same and they are only capable to handle half the amount of “bones” that otherwise Urho3D engine supports on mobile platforms. And our sample apps are not specifically written for RPI.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:07:04.229Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":4,"readers_count":3,"score":0.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":1352,"topic_slug":"raspberry-pi-2-problems","display_username":"Yao Wei Tjong","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_building.html#Building_RaspberryPi","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Urho3D - Documentation - Building Urho3D","clicks":1},{"url":"http://sf.net","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"SourceForge - Download, Develop and Publish Free Open Source Software","clicks":0}],"read":true,"user_title":"Admin","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":4,"hidden":false,"trust_level":4,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":7711,"name":"","username":"toliaferrode","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/t/22d042/{size}.png","created_at":"2015-09-09T16:57:07.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThanks for the welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh ok I just assumed, sorry about that. Precompiled header, not a sound codec as I thought. I was thinking PCM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs far as I can tell the latest and only GCC in Raspbian is 4.6. I noticed that Wikipedia has the latest as 5.x. So I suppose I’d have to compile it myself?
