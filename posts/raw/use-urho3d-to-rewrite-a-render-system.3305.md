Hey, Im new here. Im trying choose some 3d engine to rewrite a render engine from a old game. I tried with irrlicht, but it isnt so optimized in animations, ogre3d its much complicate, and now i want to try with urho3d.

I want to know if urho3d its good for game perfomance, with animations etc. I want to use with directx9, So, what you guys think? Its a good think try with urho3d? Or thats will not help for what i want to do?

@Sorry for english
