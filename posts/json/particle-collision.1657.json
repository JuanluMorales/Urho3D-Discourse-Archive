I am not actually sure if it would speed things even up compared to actually doing actual ray cast against the environment.

I meant maximum of 10000 particles on any given time. I haven’t really used bullet, but if the maximum amount of particles at any given time is less than 100, is the Bullet really that slow, that it really would plummet all the performance?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I was thinking is, if you create collision geometry for your particle emitter, and with the assumption that it remains still, you should be able to predict the path the particles take during the creation of a particle. Since position would be calculated from s = v0t + (1/2)at^2, you could solve the t from the equation to see when the particle will hit something. On the other hand I am not really sure how easy it is to actually solve the t from trying to calculate the surroundings when the particle hits something = collision. Basically this would be same as doing ray cast at the creation time, just that when you add gravity to the particles, the movement of the particle becomes parabel, without gravity you could just do single ray cast on creation of a particle to determine the time it will collide to a surrounding object.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the problem is, that calculating the collision time during creation only works if the system doesn’t have outside interference, which is probably the more common case. The particle system is moving, so the collision geometry around the particle emitter changes, or someone enters inside the emitter emitting range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the sphere, I meant something like geometrical sphere. Like as long as particles are inside the sphere, they aren’t colliding with anything. Since the mathematical equation to sphere is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2, you could simply check if particle is within the radius of the sphere. Also you could possibly generate something like octree for the particle emitter and do collision checks for that. Then determine which of the particles remain in which octree and you would skip checking collision of the particles that aren’t inside the octree that actually has a collision. You would just have to think a way to have a good sorting of particles to easily find which octree has the particle inside of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorry, I am not sure if any of this
