Very original game concept and I really like smooth graphics fx in the game.

I've been working on heXon this week and updated the version on [itch](https://luckeyproductions.itch.io/hexon/devlog/44113/mirages-and-death-flowers). Apparently this did not go unnoticed to Erik Letson who's in the middle of launching [FOSSGN](https://www.fossgn.com/news/2018/08/hexon-update-out.html). heXon got featured in one of the first articles on this new website dedicated to free and open source games! :smiley:

You're welcome! :slight_smile:
Be aware that my workflow is quite chaotic, I jump between projects and their constituent facets a lot. Hence do not expect the code to be polished or otherwise class material. Also, feel free to point out any anomalies you may encounter by opening an issue or PR on GitLab.
