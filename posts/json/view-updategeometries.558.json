It is a fairly cheap function overall compared to the overall callstack, but adding a few more cache’s (or maybe an Event or two depending on how fast that call process is) could cut out a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e of the tests.  Specially in my scene I am noticing on line 1179 the loop of \u003ccode\u003efor (unsigned i = 0; i \u0026lt; renderPath_-\u0026gt;commands_.Size(); ++i)\u003c/code\u003e are testing all of the renderPaths for if \u003ccode\u003e(!IsNecessary(command))\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eif (command.type_ == CMD_SCENEPASS)\u003c/code\u003e, wouldn’t it be better to have a dedicated cache/vector for the ones that fullfill these that are updated as necessary instead of looping?  This one overall is trivial though, the big one that had a lot of hits on my scene was on line 1219 the loop of \u003ccode\u003efor (PODVector\u0026lt;Drawable*\u0026gt;::Iterator i = geometries_.Begin(); i != geometries_.End(); ++i)\u003c/code\u003e loops over all geometries, of which there are quite a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e, but it just tests for either \u003ccode\u003eif (type == UPDATE_MAIN_THREAD)\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003eelse if (type == UPDATE_WORKER_THREAD)\u003c/code\u003e, yet all of them in my scene are UPDATE_NONE, so it is looping needlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust a notice I had, it is still very little time compared to, say, just clearing the screen, but it looks like a simple optimization that could potentially give a noticeable boost, though tests would say for sure instead of just guessing.  \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:01:21.792Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":1,"reads":2,"readers_count":1,"score":5.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":558,"topic_slug":"view-updategeometries","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":42,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":3129,"name":"Lasse Öörni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2014-11-17T09:11:38.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eLooping the renderpath commands even several times should basically be negligible, and it doesn’t grow with the number of scene objects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question of looping through the geometries to find out how they’re updated is a good one, that can possibly be moved as part of the base pass gathering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenerally, a profiler like CodeAnalyst will know best the code hotspots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEDIT: after going through the code, I cannot in good conscience move the geometry’s update type check earlier. It’s probably something that would never effect 99.9% of cases, but there’s the odd possibility that due to some interaction, eg. when an object is viewed from multiple views, it would first return being OK with a threaded update, but later (close to rendering) it would actually decide it needs a main thread update, for example updating its vertex buffer. In that case, if we had already determined it to want a threaded update and went with that, we’d crash. It has to be noted that it would be a nice optimization, because in the HugeObjectCount sample I see the SortAndUpdateGeometry block to take 0.5 ms, which cannot be called negligible anymore. That scene has 62500 objects though, so it’s an extreme case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEDIT 2: by re-checking threaded updated drawables (there should be very few of them) just before they’re put to the threaded queue, the optimization should be
