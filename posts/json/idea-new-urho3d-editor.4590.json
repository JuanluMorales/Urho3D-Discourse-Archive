Well, I had an idea for this.\u003cbr\u003e\nAs a community, because I do not have time to wok on it myself- work on an integration into an IDE such as Code::Blocks, that will display a rendered view in a separate window/tab whatever of the IDE.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis would work through the use of wxWidget‚Äôs OpenGL context, Urho3D passes into the wxWidgets OpenGL context, and renders there. Objects put into this scene have the code automatically put in the proper file for the editor to compile. The rendering based of objects that are put in could be done through scripting, maybe? Or it gets put in then the user has to recompile each time. I haven‚Äôt thought that far. This is to implement the coding side to it, for more dynamic scenes. Heck, static scenes could be made with the current Urho3D editor, then loaded into this plugin/project, with dynamic objects rendered in, as those are code based compared to a file based thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway its just an idea.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf anyone wants to take it and run, I will gladly contribute when I have the time.\u003cbr\u003e\nI know there‚Äôs lots of ideas for the editor, but hey what‚Äôs one more?
