You should use plain vanilla GCC when you intend to target native Linux platform. Last time I tried C::B on my Linux host system (Fedora 64bit), I have not encountered any problem. I was using GCC 4.9.x then but my GCC has been upgraded to 5.1 since. I have also changed my IDE from Eclipse to Clion but they all use the GCC native toolchain with ccache support enabled. No issue so far. So, I reckon if I change the frontend IDE to C::B now with the same GCC backend, it should just work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suspect your problem has something to do with the version of GCC and somehow it has tripped over due to the way we setup PCH (precompiled header). Try to upgrade your GCC compiler toolchain to 4.9 or later. This is always the problem when using Debian-based distros where stability is more important over having the latest and greatest version available. Alternatively, instead of using 1.4, try to download the latest Urho3D from master and then passing this build option when generating the Urho3D project file: -DURHO3D_PCH=0. This new build option will instruct the build system not to use PCH at all. Thus, if indeed your GCC version tripped over due to PCH then this build option should side step the problem.
