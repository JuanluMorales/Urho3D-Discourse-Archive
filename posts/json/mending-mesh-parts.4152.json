Plain and simple we have 2 problems:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBone count limit per geometry is quite small. While big engines like UE4 and Unity\u003cbr\u003e\nsomehow manage, Urho can’t handle lots of bones. The solution which seems obvious is to split mesh using materials, and that is where we het second issue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFor multi-geometry meshes, only first geometry is affected by skeletal deformation.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis issue can be addressed by mesh splitting (even naive approach works) but we have the following issue with split meshes:\u003cbr\u003e\nRegardless of how meshes were produced, either exported as separated parts or multi-geometry, we have visible seams in shading. Also when bones are animated, we see holes in mesh.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what I’m trying to do is finding seam vertices and make their normal and blend weights and indices the same (set from main geometry to all other parts). \u003cstrong\u003eIs this idea looks sane?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf yes, what would be most efficient way to do that?
