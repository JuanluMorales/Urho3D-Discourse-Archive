Hi everyone,

I'm having trouble getting Urho3D to work with emscripten. I just freshly installed Urho3D 1.7.1 zip file and emscripten sdk. I learned from this forum that the build system (Travis) used by Urho3D uses version 1.35 of emscripten. At the time of writing, I find it impossible to download 1.35 version of emscripten. Any ideas would be appreciated!

Thanks

Use master branch. Maligayang pagdating.

Thanks weitjong. It worked!

For others who experience the same problem like mine, clone the git instead of downloading "Urho3D-1.7.1.zip" or tar.
