What do you achieve from this? Why dont we just put the actual API data types instead of void pointers? Sure it will increase the number of ifdefines but at least the framework will be a lot more clear and will help to add new APIs easily.\u003cbr\u003e\nFor example: In DX12, we need to store the CPU handle of a SRV. Now to follow the framework style, I need to add another void pointer to the texture class and then go around casting it everywhere as a CPU handle in the DX12Texture class implementation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrho3D is a developer’s engine.
