Feel free to PM me on the forums, Gitter or through [Wire](https://wire.com/en/download/) if you want to improve your Blender workflow.

What do you mean improve my workflow?

I gave it a try and it seems like a nice utility. I think the most useful thing is probably the snapping features.

My biggest complaint is the painful download process. Why do I have to register an email and everything to get it? Just put it on github and save everyone the hassle.

Instead of making Blender easier to use through add-ons I could maybe help you (or anyone else) improve your workflow using built-in functions, some of which you may currently be unaware.
