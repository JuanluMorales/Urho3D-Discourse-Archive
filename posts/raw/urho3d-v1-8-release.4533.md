Hi,

Are there any plans for releasing Urho3D V1.8?

Previously, the time gap between releases was less than one year, but this time more than a year has passed and I could not find any discussion about the next release.

Thank you for a great engine!

Aren't you using the latest version from the [master branch](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/tree/master/)?
I mean, what's in a number?

I use V1.7 on my project.
An official release is usually considered more stable because it assumes some effort spent on code hardening.
