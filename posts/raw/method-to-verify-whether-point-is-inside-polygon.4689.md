Hello

Is there in Urho3D any helper method to verify that a point (Vector2) is inside a polygon (Vector2[ ])?
It is a common problem with detailed description [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_in_polygon).

If there is no such method in Urho3D maybe it would helpful to integrate it.

BR,

Ladislav

There are C++ implementations at the botton of [this](http://geomalgorithms.com/a03-_inclusion.html) page! :wink:
