[details="Solved"]
Im looking for someone that have a good knowledge on Urho3D to make MODS on Urho3D Classes. 

What I need:
 -Modify **Network.cpp** to accept multiple server connections (client connect to Server1 and Server2)
 -Possibility to choose what server you will send the packet
 -No limits on server connections, this way, should be allocate on a vector

I believe that its very simple and for who have a good knowledge on Urho3D (that not my case), will make this easilly and faster.

If interested, reply here or send me a PM.
Thanks!
