I've recently came across this interesting approach to GI after reading the Tesseract rendering pipeline documentation: http://jcgt.org/published/0003/04/06/

However, after reading the shaders and trying to integrate those into Urho3D, i think i might be missing something. Would it be possible to cache the information across steps?
