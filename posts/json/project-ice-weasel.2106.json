The scene can be queried for gravitational forces at any location in 3D space. The system is very rough right now (I search for the closest probe and just directly use its direction and force, so transitions are very jagged), but I was thinking about building a tetrahedral mesh out of the probes and use some form of spacial partitioning to decrease lookup time. That way you can query in which tetrahedron you’re in and interpolate the gravity parameters between its 4 vertices, and transitioning between probes would be smooth and unnoticeable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this system it will be possible to create things a l? \u003ca href=\"http://artdiscovery.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/3-IMG_1871.jpg\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eM.C.
