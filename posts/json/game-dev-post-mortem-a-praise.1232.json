Why?  Well, your first is always exciting \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e  You can see it here \u003ca href=\"http://discourse.urho3d.io/t/lumaks-wraptiles/1231/1\" data-bbcode=\"true\"\u003ehttp://discourse.urho3d.io/t/lumaks-wraptiles/1231/1\u003c/a\u003e.   My game is only 2D but it should say a lot about how good the engine is if someone can just pick it up can make a game in less than 2 months (barely).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, this post is not so much about my game, but more about this engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is my first open source engine that I’ve ever used. I did evaluate Epic’s game engine and Unity engine prior to looking at Urho3D, but I decided against them for a few reasons.  I wanted something light weight and not too overly architected (code bloat) yet optimized, supported latest graphics capabilities, free to develop on multiple platforms, and that I could write my code once for multiple platforms with very little changes on my end.   Needless to say, it was very difficult to find such engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I discovered Urho3D.  I’ve been learning this engine for less than 2 months and feel as though I’ve only scratched the surface.  There’s so much to this engine.  When I first started looking at it I was excited and couldn’t wait to write a game with it.  As it turns out, I found that this engine gave me more than what I had expected.  From well architected classes, to well designed message event system, to mem dumps that helped me detect memory leaks that I wasn’t freeing properly early on, to cmake build process which you don’t have to bother learning because devs/contributors done all that for you, I can’t say enough about how awesome this engine is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo here’s to you originators/devs/contributors, kudos!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e;tldr - this is an awesome engine!\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:06:14.151Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":6,"reads":6,"readers_count":5,"score":31.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":1232,"topic_slug":"game-dev-post-mortem-a-praise","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://discourse.urho3d.io/t/lumaks-wraptiles/1231","internal":true,"reflection":false,"title":"Lumak's Wraptiles","clicks":0}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":256,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":7010,"name":"","username":"Lumak","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/l/8491ac/{size}.png","created_at":"2015-08-03T12:59:32.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eAlright, maybe I’ll write a bit of post mortem about my game development and how it went if anyone is curious.  Albeit, it’s not a 3D game, some might be curious about Android development anyways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you saw from my comments above, the least of my worries about my game development was using Urho3D.  If anything, that was easiest part of my development due to lots of great features already built into it.  More time was spent working on other stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m no artist, so I spent/wasted lots of time trying to create art assets and probably created several iterations on what looked about right - AND it looks like that!
