It takes me about a minute, 2 minutes to fully load the site then another minute or two to complete a login.  If I post something, it disconnects and I'm in doubt that I posted something.

It's difficult to spam the forum when things are this slow!  :wink:

What's funny is it works fine if I access the forum over tor.

It seems prophpbb.com is down (or very slow):

First time I noticed the forums being down was over a month ago. Two or three times after that.
