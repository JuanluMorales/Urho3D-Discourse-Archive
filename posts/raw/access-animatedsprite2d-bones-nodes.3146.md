Hello everyone,

I am trying to add new nodes to the bone nodes of my AnimatedSprite2D made with Spriter and it's not clear to me where these bone nodes are. I ultimately want to attach things to those nodes like other sprites or particle effects. Any ideas? Or if this feature doesn't exist, will it be available sometime in the future?
