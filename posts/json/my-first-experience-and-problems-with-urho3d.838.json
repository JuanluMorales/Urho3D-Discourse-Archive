And I never had any kind of game inside the VM. I wasn’t sure if it can do 3D like games properly. So I copied the Bin folder to the host and and the samples suddenly worked!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://s4.postimg.org/vdic73ov1/Urho3_D_sample3_DUDE.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere should be some warnings if Urho3D can’t display 3D correctly or load the materials or whatever didn’t work in my VM. I nearly abondoned Urho3D.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m using Windows, 32bit, OpenGL, MinGW 4.9.1, CMake-GUI and CodeBlocks. I wrote all the steps down I had to do to make Urho3D work. There seems to be a Wiki, but no Index? Is there a tutorial or HowTo section somewhere?\u003cbr\u003e\nParts of the documentation seems to be older and mention stuff like Visual Studio 2009…\u003cbr\u003e\nI could write a short guide how I build Urho3D 1.32. It was far less painfull as trying to build Ogre…\u003cbr\u003e\nAh, I couldn’t build you documentation with the CMake URHO3D_DOCS flag. CodeBlocks tried to build some .dot files, which I think are image files. After deactivating that flag, make was able to finish everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy Background:\u003cbr\u003e\nThe last time I did something with game development is years ago. I used Ogre back then, before that CrystalSpace and before that tried Irrlicht with no success. CrystalSpace worked at first but had broken shadows and physics and seems quite inactive since then. So I searched again and found Ogre and was happy for quite a while. But they dropped their MinGW-Binary-Release sometime and it’s hard/impossible to build manually. So Ogre died a bit for me. The last stable is still from 2012. As I used that, it just came out. They seem to be working on Ogre 2.0/2.1, maybe they will have an MinGW-Binary-Release again and better support in general. But for now: nah…\u003cbr\u003e\nSo I searched and compared a lot of other 3d/game engines and the two most promising ones are Urho3D and Delta3D. Urho3D seemes to have better support for Blender so I started with that.\u003cbr\u003e\nI’m working as a C++ software developer in a small company. We are doing image editing software for Windows \u0026amp; Mac with Qt. We are still not selling that much (but are improving) and can’t currently support any free software project with money or man power (though I would like that). Would be great if that would change. There are so many companies profitting from free software without giving anything back, f\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eg a\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003es… \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=9\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have still so many ideas regarding games and it was so fun doing something in that field (though image editing software is also not bad), and after years of just thinking, am trying to do something again. I’m always trying to use free software, my tools were always: Blender, Gimp and CodeBlocks. Though I also like QtCreator (Codeblocks has always had some flaws, QtCreator has now a bit less).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy next steps will be to move my Urho3D development to my host and try to compile own stuff. I think I’ll start with your water sample because it has terrain and water. Hope that terrain is editable and supports texture splatting.\u003cbr\u003e\nNext I’ll try to make models with Blender and export them. There are some forum posts regarding Blender export but no (video) tutorial/howto? You could need that. I also hated the lack or organisation of the Ogre tutorials/howtos. Everyone in the forum seems always happily using something, but everone needs to spend hours trying to get something to work, because no one of the “inner circle” shares his secrets by making a small tutorial…\u003cbr\u003e\nI wasted like 2 hourse of my 3 hours of experimenting with Urho3D with searching and experimenting with CMake and Codeblocks custom Makefiles. A tutorial would have saved that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt bothers me that free software engines are so far behind commercial engines like Unreal-Engine, CryEngine or Unity (though that one is not comparable). Free software engines can be slower / less optimized and not have all the features because of lack of man power. But they should have enough potential for lighter projects, small teams and hobbyists. Not just because of lack of money, but also because of the free software ideal. They are all lacking good / up-to-date tutorials, material/model collections, better organization and transparency. There are also dozens of concurrenting engines, most abandoned though or focusing a specific genres/niches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis became a bit like a super long blog post and took me over an hour… overthinking again…\u003cbr\u003e\nComments welcome to all the stuff I mentioned.\u003cbr\u003e\nI didn’t read that many other forum posts, so some things may already have been mentioned somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egreetings from germany\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einb4 no replies because Urho3D abondoned too\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:03:20.180Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":309,"reads":40,"readers_count":39,"score":1548.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":838,"topic_slug":"my-first-experience-and-problems-with-urho3d","display_username":"gawag AKA damu","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":206,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":4670,"name":"hd_","username":"hdunderscore","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/hdunderscore/{size}/1151_2.png","created_at":"2015-02-12T06:09:46.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eHi and welcome to the forums \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=5\" title=\":smiley:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":smiley:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess the first thing I’ll mention is that we do have documentation that is updated as new features are added and changed:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.32/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eurho3d.github.io/documentation/1.32/index.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImportant to note though, that that link is for Urho 1.32 so if you are building from github, you’ll want to change the dropdown toggle to HEAD, eg:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eurho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/index.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/pages.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eurho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/pages.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/annotated.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eurho3d.github.io/documentation/H … tated.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll see there’s build instructions, a few overviews and after that you’ll need to dive into class documentation, samples and perhaps look through the Code Exchange subforum for learning resources.

Though the physics itself is good. The Snow theme could be replaced by grass and normal balls, that would make it more realistic (because snowballs don’t really bounce).\u003cbr\u003e\nThe GUI could also be nicer (the health bar). There seem to be GUI feature in Urho3D but the samples aren’t showing a real example besides one with a checkbox and a button. The sample with movable buttons is also not really working for me, there is no cursor.\u003cbr\u003e\n(These are all not really complains but improvement suggestions.

But it’s crashing at surface-\u0026gt;SetViewport(0,rttViewport); (line 223) because RenderSurface* surface=renderTexture-\u0026gt;GetRenderSurface(); (two lines above) returned a 0 to ‘surface’. Commented that out for now and the water reflection looks weird. Maybe I’ll start a new thread in the support section if I can’t figure that out or find a solution in the forum. The documentation doesn’t mention why GetRenderSurface could return a 0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m impressed what Urho3D can do besides just displaying graphics. Ogre is only a graphics engine and I had to add physics with Bullet (and sound) myself. Urho3D has both already integrated and looks great, solid and fast in the examples. There is also a path finding sample. The samples show a lot of potential to make all kind of games with the stuff already in Urho.\u003cbr\u003e\n(Btw: the camera in the physics example with the box pyramid should be moved closer to the pyramid. I started the sample and shot a box without moving and it landed like 2m in front of the pyramid which was kinda funny. Even small things like that make Urho3D look unpolished.)\u003cbr\u003e\nI see Urho3D more as a concurrent to CrystalSpace (also a complete game engine) and not just Ogre (only graphics engine). Urho3D has a lot of potential to be the number one free software (complete) game engine. CrystalSpace seems so abandoned and seems to be only developed by one guy (or a super slow team). I also remember CrystalSpace having glitchy shadows and physics. Urho3D could take it’s place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many people are working on Urho?\u003cbr\u003e\nThere is room for improvements, most things I found for now are relatively minor though.\u003cbr\u003e\nI can’t even find your wiki anymore.

I always compared to other free engines, mainly the big/prominent ones Ogre, CrystalSpace and Irrlicht (though I don’t get Irrlichts popularity).\u003cbr\u003e\nThe commercial ones seem to have mainly more GUI tools like were one can click together his animations and some game logic. I never liked WYSIWYG stuff (like GUI editors), made many bad experiences with them and prefer doing such things by code (more dynamic). It may not be a good idea to try to copy every features (even if there would be much more man power).\u003cbr\u003e\nI always see Unity as a toy or learning engine and not as a professional high-end AAA engine like Unreal (\u003ca href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/unreal-engine-4\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eunrealengine.com/unreal-engine-4\u003c/a\u003e), but maybe I don’t know enough about Unity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the things all free engines seem to fail at, are directly and easily usable materials and effects. Is there some kind of gallery for those for Urho? Like texture with normal mapping or chrome effects or whatever? Ogre tried something like that but that didn’t really work the last time I checked. I never really got into those shader thingies (partly because the Ogre ones worked so badly).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNews:\u003cbr\u003e\nExported simple test mesh from Blender with your exporter and that worked perfectly at the first try. Much better as those fishy Ogre exporters  :mrgreen: .\u003cbr\u003e\nThough it tried to use a material technique that wasn’t were and I copied a name from another material. And the paths to the textures weren’t interpreted as relative. Can the names be relative?\u003cbr\u003e\nAdded my test model to my app (based on water example) and bound a light to the camera node. Yay working shadows! Noticed that the camera node is outside the scene and couldn’t bind the light directly to it? That’s a bit weird and works with Ogre.\u003cbr\u003e\nSo nice progress being made (though I already know Ogre and Urho is similiar).

This physics stress test looked already good and seems to beat the Half Life 2 engine by far (try that many boxes in Garrys Mod -\u0026gt; NOPE).\u003cbr\u003e\nEasy to use doesn’t mean Unitys scripting stuff. CrystalSpace was terrible to use. Ogre and Urho are much better with their hierarchical node system. Until now Urho doesn’t seem to be hard. Though materials/shaders may be an issue.

It’s valid to have the camera to be outside scene, this is intended to ease load / save situations, because load destroys all objects, after which you have to re-assign the camera \u0026amp; viewport, if it was part of the scene. Having camera outside, this problem is averted, but the flipside is that you cannot make any components attached to the camera or its children render, as they cannot find your scene’s octree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough this is a bit offtopic, if you see Unity as a toy you’re (IMO) underestimating it.

Otherwise both engines are complex, professional beasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the lack of usable assets in open source engines, I would say that this is due to them being mostly worked on by coders, and development time being focused on the framework itself (ie. creating means for users to create their own content, while forgetting to actually demonstrate all those means) This of course varies with the devs’ personal interests, so if someone is interested in eg. modern shading models they will likely work on those.
