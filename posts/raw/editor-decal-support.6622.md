I extended the editor a bit and hacked together a decal placement editor. It's not feature complete yet for main branch, but was good enough for my case:

I'm planning to add transform randomization, formalize the UI, decal editing and removal, and preview the material below. Any other suggestions to it?
Also there's a bug in `EditorSpawn.as`, line 419. pls fix
