I am thinking about query Octree with a cylinder.
Ends up finding [geometrictools](https://www.geometrictools.com/Source/Intersection3D.html), which had already done many kinds of intersection with Boost v1.0 license.
Seems each class is templated, header only, easy to integrate to project.

How do you think about it?
