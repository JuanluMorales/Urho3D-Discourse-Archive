Queries and so on would need to transform from global space to local space and the reverse for information coming out. Debug draw also needs to apply the transform to world space so diagnostics are correctly displayed. Crowds also need to account for it if being used.

In theory you can move dtPolys however you like but the linking of polys and tiles is all very brittle and explicit.
