I'm trying to create a proper first-person camera in Urho, one that does not allow models attached to the camera to clip through geometry. For example:

[forum.unity3d.com/attachments/fi ... jpg.155452](http://forum.unity3d.com/attachments/firstpersonview_feature-jpg.155452)

In Unity, i can usually fix this by putting stuff into separate layers: [answers.unity3d.com/questions/41 ... walls.html](http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/41298/fps-gun-clippes-through-walls.html)
