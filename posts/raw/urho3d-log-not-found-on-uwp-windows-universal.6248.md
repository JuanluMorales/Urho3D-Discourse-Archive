Things are going wrong for us using UrhoSharp on UWP (some objects not showing up).   But we cannot find the Urho3D.log file here.   On Android the log is piped to the Device Log, but on UWP, where can we find the log output?  

On Win32/WPF, the Urho3D.log is found in the application folder.  For UWP, we can't find it.
