There's an error which still persist on android build of IK.

as already noted by @Pencheff [here](https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/android-studio-2-3-build-with-gradle/2995?u=johnnycable)

I think it takes a guard there... gave me no error while building on Os X... maybe the system "incorrectly" mistake android for linux?

If you believe this is a bug then you should report it in the Urho Github issue tracker. Thanks.
Will have a look later regardless.  ðŸ˜„

Please check out the latest commit in the master branch. It should fix the debug build configuration for Android platform.

Sometimes I think that you are more improtant for Urho than all other contributors taken together. BTW, is it hard to maintain build system?

No, not at all. When I started to look at this, I was a CMake newbie as well. The only advantage I have is years of Unix experience for scripting.

Goddammit! It works!
