Hi guys,
I tried Android Studio today and after a lot of hassling couldn't get it to work perfectly. What is your best choice for Android IDE ?

On my tests I only do scripting with just Notepad2 and command line build.. :wink:

Maybe you should try [b]Eclipse + ADT[/b]?

I am using Eclipse with CDT and ADT plugins. Though lately I am trying to migrate to Android Studio/IntelliJ IDEA, but I haven't cut over yet, still have lots of things I haven't figured out how.
