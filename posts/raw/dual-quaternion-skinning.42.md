In short, Dual Quaternion Skinning solves the issues of matrix-based skinning equations -- typically near joints the matrices will cancel out and the vertex skin will 'pinch' towards the joint. This is known as the 'candywrapper' effect.

The effect is clearly visible in the Ninja demos. 

There are a bunch of online resources that can assist with this, that being:

- OGRE supports dual quaternion skinning as well, and their source files will likely be a large source of help.

So this is my first post, I'll post the link below.
