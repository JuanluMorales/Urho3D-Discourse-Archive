Hi everybody,

I'm very new to Urho3d and I must admit one of the only things that lets this engine down is its inability to import models that aren't .mdl its incredibly frustrating as I have models that work perfectly fine but importing them are a huge pain. I have manged to import one model so far. 

With that out the way, I'm having trouble making a new Skybox. I can make them in blender no problem, i export the .xml but when I open the game, black screen.

any help?
