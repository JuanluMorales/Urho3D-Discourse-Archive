The thing is I’ve got a config file from which multiple components in the same node need to take info. I thought: “Why would them all need to query the same XML file over and over? Instead I could make a component that parses the config file (the properties component) and then make other components in that node look for the properties in the properties component”. The problem is most of those properties are needed at initialization time, and if I can’t ensure the properties component is loaded before the others, it won’t work.
