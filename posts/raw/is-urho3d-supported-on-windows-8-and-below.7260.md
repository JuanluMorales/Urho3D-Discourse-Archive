Hi, I'm awdqef. I am very new to this community and since I only have a Windows 8 Computer, I wonder if I can run Urho3d on Windows 8 or even below if possible?

Visual Studio 2017 (and probably other compilers) can generate code for WinXP+ level systems.
So I don't see any fundamental restrictions that stop you from using the engine on older versions of Windows.
