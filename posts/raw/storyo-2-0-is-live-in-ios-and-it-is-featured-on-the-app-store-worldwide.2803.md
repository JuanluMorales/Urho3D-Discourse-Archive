Hi all

Just to let you know that Storyo 2.0 was launched in iOS last Thursday (2017/02/16) and Apple is featuring it worldwide (more than 130 countries).
Rendering in this new version is 100% based on UrhoSharp, which is a Urho 3D c# wrapper !

Thank you all!

Manuel

Looks cool! I don't have any IOS devices are you planning a release on Android? How many downloads did you get so far?
