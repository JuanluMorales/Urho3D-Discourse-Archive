All objects that have their world space axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) intersect the zone’s volume are assigned to the zone.

This means that if viewing the scene from one zone, the contents of the other zone will not be visible except when there is a portal connecting the zones. However, sometimes it is convenient to represent a single interior space through a combination of Zones so that when any of these zones is visible, all other zones that are part of the same interior space are visible.
