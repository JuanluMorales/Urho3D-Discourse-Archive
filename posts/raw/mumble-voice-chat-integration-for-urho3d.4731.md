Hi all,

I've created an Urho3D integration for [Mumble Voice Chat](https://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Main_Page) to enable positional audio for voice chat depending on where your character is in game. You can find it here:

This code is based on [https://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Link](https://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Link).

I just tested it on Windows but should also work on Linux.

Best, Stefan
