For basic demos, this is fine and all. However by sending controls to the server and waiting for it to update, we\u2019re essentially stuck in the Quake days. Now practically any major game incorporates some form of client-side prediction. Some games will let the client be the ultimate authority on the player\u2019s character, while other games will attempt to \u201cpredict\u201d where the client should be while still adhering to the server\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p>I would like to have additional options available within the scene to allow client control of certain nodes. I think the way it could work is that a node could have one of 3 states:</p>\n<p>[<em>]NoControl - The same as it currently exists. The server has ultimate authority and this cannot be changed by the client.<br>\n[</em>]SoftControl - Allow the client to update the character locally. The server will still have ultimate authority, and can make corrections to the client-side as necessary.<br>\n[*]HardControl - Allow the client to update the character locally. These updates are then sent to the server to propagate to the other clients.</p>\n<p>The only downside to this is we would need some way of implementing client-side prediction, keeping track of Scene states and keeping all of the clients up-to-date.</p>", "post_number": 1, "post_type": 1, "updated_at": "2017-01-02T01:00:23.835Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 0, "incoming_link_count": 38, "reads": 10, "readers_count": 9, "score": 192.0, "yours": false, "topic_id": 439, "topic_slug": "bi-directional-scene-replication", "display_username": "", "primary_group_name": null, "flair_name": null, "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": null, "flair_color": null, "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": true, "user_title": null, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 80, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false}, {"id": 2350, "name": "", "username": "izackp", "avatar_template": "https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/i/9de053/{size}.png", "created_at": "2014-09-15T22:06:03.000Z", "cooked": "<p>When you have the client make the decisions you\u2019re going to lead into \u2018conflicts\u2019.

Once you get what happened from the server you need to retroactively apply it to the entity.  This can cause the npc to \u2018jump\u2019. You can fix this problem by having two separate locations stored for each entity: A graphical location (on screen), and a logical location (where it actually is). The logical location will match the server as best as possible while the graphical location will interpolate the best it can with the logical location.</p>\n<p>There is also another technique called command/event/or input buffering\u2026 Where the user\u2019s input or (game events) gets placed into a buffer to execute at a future time. The hope is that the delayed execution will give the clients time to read it before it needs it to minimize de-synchronization.</p>\n<p>As for how to accomplish this with Urho3D\u2026 I don\u2019t know yet.

After reading the first one, two questions come to my mind.<br>\n[ol]<br>\n[li] I understand why the server needs to have the authoritative role in maintaining the critical game states to prevent any cheating. What I don\u2019t understand is, why does it have to do it alone without taking the advantage of the computing power of the networked clients? For example, can\u2019t the server just validating a \u201chit\u201d claimed by a client as oppose to validating each shoot event/message sent by all the clients to see if they \u201chit\u201d. The bogus \u201chit\u201d sent by a cheating client would still got caught while the server doesn\u2019t have to do that much work. That way, it should not cause serious calculation lags when lots of people are shooting at the same time, right? Not unless they are all cheaters claiming hits all the times <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\">.[/li]<br>\n[li] On the flip side of the coin, it briefly mentioned \u201cman-in-the-middle\u201d attack is being foiled by not letting client to alter critical game state. But what if there is a technically inclined cheater who can create a \u201ccheat proxy\u201d that actually listens to all the events/messages in the game world, and in the split second can calculate the precise position of the other player in the cheater vicinity, and send a network package stating the cheater shot in that calculated position.

I expect there must be a technical difficulty or drawback that I am not aware of in designing it as I described. Hence I am asking the question. Since I have no prior experience, what it am about to say next may be just nonsense. I am agree with you that the hit test calculation could be complex but it should not be more complex than the same test carried out on the server (which could do them many times and still manages to keep the game ticks). If I could do it my way then the shot is fired, client could check for potential hit locally in real time, send a package to server containing the shoot message + a \u201chit\u201d message (if client claims it). These two messages could arrive in just one network package. When I referred to distributed computing earlier, I didn\u2019t mean another round trip communication between server and client. So I believe this extra hit test on the client side could be done much faster than what you stated.</p>\n<p>As for the cheating scenario you are afraid of, it won\u2019t happen because the shoot message is sent by user firing the shot which is more eager to claim a hit rather than not.

Essentially with soft control, you have the server running the same exact simulation as the client, but the client performs client-side prediction which is synchronized with the server. Meanwhile with hard control, the server does not simulate the client interactions. Instead the client performs its interactions, sends it to the server, and propagates to other clients. In this case, server-side enforcement would be a set of rules that runs separately to keep the client within defined constraints (limited client speed, teleportation detection, interaction distance, etc\u2026), without running the entire simulations.</p>", "post_number": 20, "post_type": 1, "updated_at": "2017-01-02T01:00:25.699Z", "reply_count": 0, "reply_to_post_number": null, "quote_count": 1, "incoming_link_count": 0, "reads": 8, "readers_count": 7, "score": 1.6, "yours": false, "topic_id": 439, "topic_slug": "bi-directional-scene-replication", "display_username": "", "primary_group_name": null, "flair_name": null, "flair_url": null, "flair_bg_color": null, "flair_color": null, "version": 1, "can_edit": false, "can_delete": false, "can_recover": false, "can_wiki": false, "read": true, "user_title": null, "bookmarked": false, "actions_summary": [], "moderator": false, "admin": false, "staff": false, "user_id": 80, "hidden": false, "trust_level": 1, "deleted_at": null, "user_deleted": false, "edit_reason": null, "can_view_edit_history": true, "wiki": false, "can_accept_answer": false, "can_unaccept_answer": false, "accepted_answer": false}, {"id": 2390, "name": "", "username": "izackp", "avatar_template": "https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/i/9de053/{size}.png", "created_at": "2014-09-17T12:54:54.000Z", "cooked": "<p>Ok it seems like you\u2019re talking about, kind of, how PSO 2 and Maple Story does their networking.</p>\n<p>I believe the server doesn\u2019t keep track of positions or physics or do any kind of simulation.
