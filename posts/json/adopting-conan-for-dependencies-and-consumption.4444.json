These days if you do any ML stuffs then you just cannot avoid to learn Python. Anyway I have now enough Python knowledge to get me started with Conan and I have time to play around with it recently. But to cut the long story short, I quickly have my doubt on Conan after my short evaluation. First of all I don’t think I would like the idea to have Conan to download prebuilt binary into my system for security reason. All binaries in my system are GPG signed from my system official repo only. PERIOD. Ok, let’s just say in future the prebuilt binary can be signed and verified just like those system packages from RPM/Deb repositories, I just don’t see how that would scale up for Conan, considering some projects like Urho3D and SDL2 do not have a canonical way to build the binary from source. The combination of build options from Urho3D and SDL2 alone would already create a huge matrix, not to mention the variants due to different settings from compiler, build type, os, arch, etc. So, the idea of having someone specify a requirement in \u003ccode\u003econanfile.txt\u003c/code\u003e and getting the signed binary installed ready for usage that actually meeting the specific project use case and need just sounds like a miracle, at least to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my short evaluation, I already having issue to “just” attempting to bring in SDL2 (from bincrafters) as one of the dependencies. Understandably the SDL2 recipe would transitively bring in its own dependencies. However, I don’t like the way the recipe draws the line between what should be system provided and what should be installed/built from source using the Conan recipe of the dependencies. And, there is no easy way to override that. For example, I cannot ask Conan to exclude \u003ccode\u003ealsa\u003c/code\u003e, it keeps tries to insist to build \u003ccode\u003elibalsa\u003c/code\u003e from source[?]. Some of CMake auto-detection magic from original SDL2 CMake build system is lost or hindered by Conan. I then attempted to create my own recipe for SDL using the recipe from bincrafters as baseline, but soon I realize if I have to write a Python script to get CMake to build SDL2 the way I like it by myself then I might as well do it without Python at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only time I see it to be useful is when I specify the header-only library as dependencies, like \u003ccode\u003eentt\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003edoctest\u003c/code\u003e. No binary, just a single header file that works for all settings and options. But even then, I find it to be a little bit intrusive to let the Conan’s generators to “pepper” the conan-specific macros to the CMakeLists.txt build script in order to allow the two integrate together. I have tried “cmake”, “cmake_paths”, and “cmake_find_packages” generators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is just my personal opinion.

All the “good things” that you mentioned above I already known or read about them before deciding to start evaluation Conan. In theory on paper it all sounds very good. But, the devil is in detail. Have you ever try to use SDL2 Conan recipe in your project so far, specifically on Linux. For me, there are nothing wrong to use some packages built by distro maintainers, especially for those packages that deal with lower level stuffs. Bullets and SDL and Alsa and PulseAudio are all available in the system repo. But I would choose to customize and build from source only for the first two, but leave the lower level packages to the one who knows the system better than me. The point is I have the option to choose where the line is drawn and not by someone else who writes the recipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo me the jury is still out whether Conan will be the C++ package manager. So to have my CMake build script committed to the one package manager now  is risky. Take the Android plugin for Gradle, for example, it actually just wraps around the CMake build script and not a single line in the CMake build script needs to be altered for the plugin to work. The rakefile in the GitHub Action workflow that I did also just wraps and invoke CMake. With Conan, this is not the case. The CMakeLists.txt needs to be made aware of Conan existence someway or another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least I agree with you on one thing. It is not easy to write a recipe for a more complex library with many options. If it was easy, I think by now there will be a few people bragging to have Conan recipe for Urho3D by now. Where are they? Even the experts in the bincrafters could not come up with SDL2 recipe that meets my taste \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\"
