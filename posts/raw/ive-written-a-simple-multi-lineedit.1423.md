Hi, not sure if this is the right place to post this sort of thing but I've made some changes to LineEdit so it supports multiple lines (can be toggled on or off). I'm planning to maybe add things like line numbering at some point in the future but for now it's quite basic. 
Where is it best for me to upload this? Is this even something people are interested in?
If people like it maybe it could be added to next release?
Thanks.

Interesting. Perhaps you can create a GitHub repo and post your link. That way it can be checked out by anyone who's interested to improve this further with you and you can also push your enhancements/commits to the main repo for consideration.

Should certainly be interesting. The preferred mechanism, like rasteron alluded to, is "pull request" from your own forked Github repo toward the Urho3D official master branch.

Ok, I've created the pull request, any feedback is appreciated.
Thanks.
