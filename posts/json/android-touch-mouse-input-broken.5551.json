When running the angelscript samples, the camera tends to swing wildly, which may be a symptom of the same problem (I‚Äôm not certain).

Not sure what‚Äôs causing that, possibly something to do with the touch screen input‚Ä¶? In any case, once I move the camera, it seems to stop, so it‚Äôs probably okay.
