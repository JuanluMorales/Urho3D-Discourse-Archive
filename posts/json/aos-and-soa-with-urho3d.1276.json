I am learning lots through this and I don’t feel like I am a good optimizer.  The general summary is that there isn’t one bottleneck.  It is very hard to use all the cpus.  In many cases I have had less cpu usage and better performance.  Also single threaded code winning in cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10% of the time is spent running perlin noise.  It runs 8 passes of perlin noise.  There isn’t much that can be done about that.  I haven’t spent more than a couple hours with the terrain generation.  This whole experiement is to have a very robust fitness test of the voxel engine so I can learn and share it with my Urho friends.  If i were making a better looking world that number would be much higher.   I will probably spend a while after I am happy with the results making the world look nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have prototypes where i build the world in to files and read out of the files.  This gets rid of the realtime world generation factor.  Reading from file is 2x faster than a quad core i7 building in parallel w/ noise functions.  My latest working version I compress the files using run length encoding.  This was a huge relief to me since the game I want to make is aiming 4k by 4k tiles and it cuts the voxel maps down by 1/5th to 1/20th of the raw size and has linear speed.  Doing this was slower than reading the raw bytes.  I have plans to reading in a compressed page and read raw data out of that I think that will be faster than the original.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found that by reading the whole file into a memory buffer and deserializing from a memory buffer was over 20x faster for run length decoding than reading byte by byte.  I had a version where I background loaded all the voxel maps to do all the decoding in parallel and this was actaully 2x slower than doing it single threaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge bottleneck is gpu uploading.  Waiting for the work queue is frustrating.  It also complicates the code to always block on the main thread.  A person should be able to upload to the gpu from another thread but drivers.  To overcome some of this problem I made a 2 slot system where the work happens on a slot and swaps back and forth so I can build while uploading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA very large challenge is conforming to how Urho does multithreading.  Urho does not like it if you leave workers working when it gets to the render phase.  It splits up the work based on the number of cores you have.  If it does not get all available cores it will hitch.  I had originally designed the system to build up over the render phase and this was disasterous.  A normal 10ms frame would hitch to 200ms if the queue wasn’t flushed before the render phase.  I am used to dumb business programming where you can have 1 million concurrency because all the code sucks and is io limited.  I can’t quite tell but things like memset might be optimized for multiple cores and might be affecting the overall output of other cores.  Even if you can run everything in parallel, synchronizing constantly and gpu uploads will always leave the system partially utilized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rewrote the streaming last weekend.  I will be rewriting it again this weekend too.  Last weekend i rewrote the streaming into its own component.  I lost fix allocation from the stack in favor of using urho’s resource memory limits.  The resource limit works really really well.  I had lost a little speed from the allocations, don’t care about that yet.  On a side note I bet the resource cache limit is not a well know feature,  there is also a resource router to redirect requests for resources.  I am going to try to load the maps in an interleaved checker patter so I can hit the resource cache more.  A huge issue is that creating 1024x1024, this is a world size of 65 km ^ 2.  The resource references is like 500 MB in stupid strings!!!  I would rather use up 500mb for a giant billboard size jpeg of some cute cats than stupid strings.  I was using the resourceref to hold onto a reference back to disk.  Naturally this sucks.  I am creating a page for maps so that each page can hold 512 maps or something.  So reducing the amount of references by 512 times will make me happy.  It will also allow slower but in memory, linear queries to the rle voxel data.  I am having fun, there are tons of issues.  I have gained a deep respect for minecraft, I am also excited because this voxel format is more powerful, more compressed, and builds faster than minecraft’s. Because it builds faster you can have bigger chunks in a draw call.  I also found out how easy it is to blow your vram budget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder if buffered reads would help urho’s loading speed in some formats where there are lots of read calls.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":10,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:06:34.978Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":1,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":11,"readers_count":10,"score":2.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":1276,"topic_slug":"aos-and-soa-with-urho3d","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"Core developer","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":15,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":7294,"name":"Lasse Öörni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2015-08-20T07:41:08.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThis actually sounds like it should be a good idea to be able to disable the Renderer’s use of worker threads at will, if the main program itself is using workers heavily.
