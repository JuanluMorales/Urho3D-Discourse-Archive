Today I had this email in my inbox:
[quote]Dear LucKey Productions team.

I noticed you have released a game and I would like to invite you to join us in the Game Development World Championship 2016.


It is a great opportunity to boost your visibility globally and won't cost you a penny.

You can join in at [thegdwc.com](http://www.thegdwc.com).

Good luck for your game and I hope to see you in the contest.

You can submit as many games as you like as long as they haven't been released before 2016. Winners are rewarded with a visit to Swedish and Finnish [i]top game companies[/i].
Anyone else joining the competition? I think it would be great to see more submission using Urho3D.
