From the documentation on network replication, it is stated:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo cut down on the needed network bandwidth the physics components can be created as local on the server: in this case the client will not see them at all, and will only interpolate motion based on the node’s transform changes. Replicating the actual physics components allows the client to extrapolate using its own physics simulation, and to also perform collision detection, though always non-authoritatively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems that creating all physics objects as local is best for bandwidth, but it would also seem better for CPU performance. In my current project physics is a huge performance concern, so I would love to have this running on the server only. Are there any downsides to this approach? Maybe some sort of physics latency?
