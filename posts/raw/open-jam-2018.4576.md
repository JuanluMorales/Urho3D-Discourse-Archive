I thought this jam might be a nice oppurtinity to show the world what Urho3D can do.

https://itch.io/jam/open-jam-2018

It starts in two days.

Are you planning to participate? It's been a while since I participated in any game jams, but unfortunately because of the school and everything else I will not be able to participate in this one, so maybe next time.

-------------------------

Modanung | 2018-10-05 17:25:22 UTC | #3

I'll participate as [LucKey Productions](https://luckeyproductions.nl/). Anyone who would like to join the cult in this can do so on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/LucKey-Productions/OpenJam2018) under one condition:
:scroll: Thou shalt use _only_ open source software in the creation process. 

Currently I'm planning to make a game featuring Urho as the main character going through some maze which would be called [**A Mazing Urho**](https://gitlab.com/luckeyproductions/a-mazing-urho). But this might change as the theme is announced, after people join in or when I conclude it's a lame path to go down. :slight_smile:

If you mean the fish then you should reach out to Lasse to see if he has any good photos of the actual fish you could use for texture-source/reference.

I know that would make my day.

-------------------------

@Sinoid In my opinion [this](http://luckeyproductions.nl/B4W/urho.html) will do for now.

The “fake eye” could be better.

-------------------------

Modanung | 2018-10-05 15:41:42 UTC | #7

@weitjong Agreed. All the textures are something close to sloppy placeholders.  Here's the [blend file](http://luckeyproductions.nl/blends/urho.blend). ;)

Apart from sharing the repo I'm glad to announce @kostik1337 has joined LucKey Productions in this jam!

Any chance to get web version of the game?
People like web stuff.

-------------------------

Modanung | 2018-10-09 12:36:51 UTC | #12

@Eugene It tends to be nicely cross-compatible too. @kostik1337 will attempt to build a web version today. You can join the [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/LucKey-Productions/OpenJam2018) if you (or anyone else) want to help out. I failed last time I tried and am taking a day off. :woozy_face:

And he did it! :smiley:

I have some minor issues with the canvas behavior (Chrome 69.0.3497.100).
When I open the game, it's:

1) Too big for my browser window, I have to move browser tab onto another screen and maximize it.
2) Getting fullscreen when I click the tab - IMO it's not how browser tabs should beahve by default.
3) Hides the mouse - quite pointless if you play the game w/o fullscreen.

I don't know how hard it is to mitigate these things tho.

Controls are unusual too.
I like the idea, will eventually try to finish the game.

-------------------------

Modanung | 2018-10-10 09:20:54 UTC | #15

@Eugene It needs some work, yes. :slight_smile: 
The movement is a bit like a dancing game in that timing is important. In the future I'd like to more clearly hint at the right moment to press a key through the swim animation.

-------------------------

Sinoid | 2018-10-11 01:37:39 UTC | #16

I was also lost at the rhythm-like bit. There really didn't seem to be any cues (that I caught on to) to clue me in that it had a rhythm factor to it. I think Emscripten might have hurt there, the framerate seemed to wave up-and-down constantly on the machine I played it on.

I came into it with probably too much of a pac-man'ish expectation.

It looked quite nice though for a hasty jam game.

-------------------------

Modanung | 2018-10-11 11:40:32 UTC | #17

Personally I think the swimming works surprisingly well (for the time spent on it) once you get the hang of it. Although I agree it needs some further tweaking.
The ideal moment to press a button is _right before_ you arrive at the center of a square.

-------------------------

Modanung | 2018-10-11 19:10:54 UTC | #18

@Eugene and @Sinoid, the [web version](https://luckeyproductions.itch.io/amazingurho) has been updated. It is confined to the frame now.

-------------------------

Eugene | 2018-10-11 20:10:06 UTC | #19

Oh, it's much better. It _works_ on my laptop, comparing to previous one. I even completed abou 50% of the level.
The remaining issue -- when I press Up, the page scrolls. I had to keep my hand on the mouse and un-scroll it.

-------------------------

Modanung | 2018-10-12 00:35:38 UTC | #20

The newly added fullscreen button should get around that problem.

-------------------------

Sinoid | 2018-10-16 05:32:41 UTC | #21

I tried the Emscripten version on a beefier machine, definitely easier as I could time my taps with the sound effect. 

Some stuff was still weird though, turning seemed to be a speed booster.

sounds like Summer Olympics :)
