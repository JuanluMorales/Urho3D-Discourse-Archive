I use DotProducts in AI Steering Behaviours (eg chase, evade) all the time, but they can be applied to many kinds of problems (ask me about the relationship between dotproduct and the plane

limit the AI’s vision from a full sensor sphere to a half-sphere (which faces the same way as the AI agent), we merely need to check that the dot result is positive (well, \u0026gt;=0, and also, that

that:\u003cbr\u003e\ndotResultCutoff = Cos(Theta)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhere Theta is the desired inclusive angle of the cone, in

you’re new to it, I guess my point is that you don’t need to really deeply understand how the maths works in game coding, you just need to be able to recognize which “common” math tools might be leveraged to solve a specific problem (if it involves vectors, then dot and cross product operators are likely to be involved in optimizing the solution).\u003cbr\u003e\nActually understanding what happens inside mystical math functions is definitely useful too, as it helps your ability to determine which math tools can be retargetted to most efficiently solve your problem at hand, but it’s not vitally important to know what goes on under the hood, as efficiency in game development is generally measured in development time, and not runtime performance.\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the record, I failed

wanted to reinforce that actually understanding the math leads to ways to solve new problems using old solutions - as opposed to just fighting each problem on its own

Note that there is no Urho3D wrapper for that particular class, but we can still access it and use it in our C++ code. This is a specialized kind of trigger object, and we can provide any of the usual candidate Shape objects, not just spheres. I just happen to know that the code for sphere testing is well optimized, so there is no harm in taking advantage of existing code.\u003cbr\u003e\nLike regular trigger objects, ghost objects do not play any part in collision responses, just collision detection. But unlike regular bullet physics objects, this “pair caching” version of a collision object, keeps a list of all the other physics objects that intersect its volume. This means that instead of performing a bunch of pairwise collision tests on your scene objects, you can just ask the ghost object what it’s touching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003caside class=\"quote no-group\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhen i meet a new math tool, i fall in love with it, its a hammer, i can use it everywhere, i dont need a screwdriver, i have a magic hammer! but then after a while i get jaded, and its just another old tool in my old tool box\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e","post_number":9,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2019-05-14T04:54:16.464Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":33,"readers_count":32,"score":11.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":5144,"topic_slug":"best-method-to-check-if-a-node-is-within-a-given-radius","display_username":"Leith Ketchell","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":3,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"suspended user","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1098,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"user_suspended":true,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":29687,"name":"魔大农 𝞍𝞎𝝳 現招蜍","username":"Modanung","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/modanung/{size}/3290_2.png","created_at":"2019-05-13T12:11:41.777Z","cooked":"\u003caside class=\"quote no-group quote-modified\" data-username=\"Leith\" data-post=\"9\" data-topic=\"5144\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/leith/40/2384_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003e Leith:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…and its just another old tool in my old tool box\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil you discover chiselling by combining your old hammer and screwdriver into something that feels like a new tool altogether. \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=10\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":10,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2019-05-13T12:11:41.777Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":9,"quote_count":1,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":33,"readers_count":32,"score":41.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":5144,"topic_slug":"best-method-to-check-if-a-node-is-within-a-given-radius","display_username":"魔大农 𝞍𝞎𝝳 現招蜍","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"","bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":2}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":192,"hidden":false,"trust_level":0,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"user_suspended":true,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":29688,"name":"Leith Ketchell","username":"Leith","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/leith/{size}/2384_2.png","created_at":"2019-05-13T13:00:37.882Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eman, that tool sounds cool, i want one right now, and i am happy to advertise them\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve mentioned that I failed math at high school, I was bored and saw no way to apply it.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe only part of math that captured my interest, was trigonometry.\u003cbr\u003e\nI fell in love with curves, with tangents, and with the simplicity of the math.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was 19, and wanted to become a toolmaker and precision engineer, I was tested on my math.
