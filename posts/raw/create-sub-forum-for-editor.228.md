Hey , 
it will be very logical to add sub forum for the editor , as it is big component by it self and keep get bigger . 
so questions can be found and asked easily 
( based on other engines forums )

also , i didn't understand and its always confuse me , what is the difference between the sub forums :
Support, and General Discussion  in both Engine and Engine related questions been asked ...  ok maybe there are some Questions in the General support that are really general 
maybe good idea just to Consolidate them both to something like "Engine Discussion " or just rename the "Support" forum to "Engine support"

Our intent is to have a only  few subforums for readability, 
otherwise we should have "General", "Feat request" , "Support"  for each component, you can add a label to specialize a thread.
