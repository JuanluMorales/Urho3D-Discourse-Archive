Currently we can remove a ValueAnimation from an ObjectAnimation using RemoveAttributeAnimation(), or toggle it on/off.
But I haven't found a way to actually remove the ObjectAnimation itself or remove a single ValueAnimation created 'outside' of an ObjectAnimation.

Please make an issue of this. There is already another related to manual ObjectAnimation control.

OK, I wasn't sure if it was missing or if I missed something.
