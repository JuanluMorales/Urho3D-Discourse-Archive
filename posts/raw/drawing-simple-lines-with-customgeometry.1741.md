Hi this is a basic question... can CustomGeometry be used to create line drawings?  I know one can use DebugRenderer to draw lines in the scene but this is for part of the scene so I prefer not to depend on debugging tool for non-debug purpose.

Thanks for info on that.

Yes, by using PrimitiveType: LINE_LIST or LINE_STRIP.
