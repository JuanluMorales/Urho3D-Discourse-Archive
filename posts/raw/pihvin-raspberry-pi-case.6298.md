Inspired by @urnenfeld's [UrhoBox](https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/rfc-the-urhobox-was-embedding-urho3d/5601) project, I'm working on a Raspberry Pi casing: **The [Pihvin](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pihvin)**
Urhopihvin translates to _mighty/hero steak_, _vin_ is the Dutch spelling of (fish) _fin_, _and_ it starts with _Pi_. :grinning:

Its shape is derived from a [fish model](https://opengameart.org/content/urho) I made earlier and a [Pi4 casing](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3723561). The space above the Pi could house a drive. @cadaver Is that close enough to where Urho got [bisected](http://www.mikseri.net/artists/urho/fish-executioner/364603/)? :wink:

Always wanted to turn that Arduino into a controller:

Canonically, he was bisected just on top of a pizza box, but that gets the point of bisection across too :)

Urho has seriously deep lore.

I also like how the shape turned out similar to that of a Dune windtrap.

In games it provides power and is constructed by all factions, while in the _books_ it is a Fremen structure that collects moisture from the air in a dry environment, filling up underground basins.
