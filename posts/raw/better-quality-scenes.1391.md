Hi

Do anyone know how I can get this type affect or texturing?

Mind you I'm going be using the dynamic lighting of Urho3D so baking the shadow diffuse might be trickie unless I darken the materials of objects around the edges to fake some shadowing.

Any other ideas would be appreciated?

That's mostly PBRs and I see some SSAO. You can also bake Radiosity/AO and throw in some cube mapping for the reflective surfaces.
