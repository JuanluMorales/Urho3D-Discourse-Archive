Hi

This is a wrapper for Magic Particles 3D (www.astralax.com) and Urho3D.

I completly rewrite old version of aster2013 that I found on this forum, this one is compatible with latest version of Magic Particles 3D (3.43).

https://github.com/fredakilla/ump3d

_Note: for now it works only with urho3d opengl (need to write the HLSL shaders)._

Please, report me bugs or incorrect effects rendering.

Looks cool. Did you enjoy the API as I haven't heard about Magic Particles before?

I didn't test for android yet and I don't have any ios device, so I can't tell you if this urho sample can work as it is. But I don't see why it couldn't works. Magic Particle 3D is cross platform and there is android and ios version of the library.

For now, I only tested under windows and linux and it works the same, just need to link with the native library version of magic particle, for mobile platform I think it is the same.
