Is there some way to create simple glsl shader inside AngelScript and add it to ResourceCache stack?
i'm tryin' different methods (VectorBuffer>File>Resource>ResourceCache), but always stuck with errors like:
-"Shader is not a data type in global namespace" - then i try implement shader class
-"'Null pointer access' - then i try write buffer to file
