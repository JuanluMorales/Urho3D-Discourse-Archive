I elaboration a bit with the water sample (23) and would like to make the water as a half sphere instead of a plane. How can I do that? Or a circular plane (but I thought a half sphere might be easier?)

Water is just an object with material applied. So make object of the shape you like (in say blender) and apply water material to it.
