Is it possible to blend animations with ragdolls? Nice example of what I'm trying to achieve:

That would also allow to create death animations that start with an artist-designed animation, but then transform into ragdolls after a few seconds.

Or this, which is also cool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyr6ts4Zefw

If player received more than X damage, turn to ragdoll. Once physics has stabilized, play getUp animation.
