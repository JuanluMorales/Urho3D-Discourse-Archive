Just wanting ‘nearby’ scene data to the portal’s camera, was planning to either shift the camera around to be equivalent distance to the portal as it is on the players side so it matches, and render a clipped area, or to render the far area clipped first, then clear the Z-buffer and render the near scene.  I am needing a ‘things are larger on the inside then they are on the outside’ type of thing, I did it with Ogre years ago, just trying to figure it out here the best
