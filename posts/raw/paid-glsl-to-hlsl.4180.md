Hey, someone with a good knowledge, I needed to rewrite GLSL shader on HLSL, bcoz Im using DX9 on my game.

For now what I needed its:
https://github.com/carnalis/ProcSky/blob/master/ProcSky.glsl
https://github.com/1vanK/Urho3DOutlineSelectionExample/blob/master/Result/MyData/Shaders/GLSL/Outline.glsl

Maybe on the future I will need more of this... I dont have a knowledge on shader language, I dont believe its so hard to do this, but for me now it's haha.

Hope someone can do this, thanks.

Please send me your e-mail via PM, then I can send you ProcSky converted to HLSL. 
Thanks.

In the https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/procsky-component/1168/8 thread has been an HLSL version contributed by @STeeL and then tested by @codingmonkey perhaps worth a look.
