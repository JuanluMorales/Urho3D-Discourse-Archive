Hello and Happy XMas! :slight_smile:
I'm new here and this is my first post. I would like to create a 3D videogame in Urho3D Engine. The game will be free and open source, and the protagonist will be Tux (the mascot of Linux). I would like to add some nice actors to my worlds, e.g. Susanne (the mascot of Blender), ElePHPant ecc.
I would like to add Android robot too. Is it protected by copyright?
Thank you
