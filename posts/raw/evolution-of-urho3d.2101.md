yep, looks nice. It's a FOSS software tool for any git/svn/etc.. repo. [gource.io/](http://gource.io/)

First knew about it from the same channel/author with [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgTMLSLJBk4]Torque3D evolution[/url]

It seems he's been showcasing some popular projects for his visualization tool.
