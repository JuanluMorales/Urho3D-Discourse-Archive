Hi,
the thought of two possible additional subforums has popped up in forum threads & PMs. I'd like to ask all of you, on whether you feel these would be warranted and useful.

1) [b]Artist forum[/b]. Discussion of creating / importing / exporting / troubleshooting art, as it relates to Urho3D. Also sharing of free art if you feel like doing so.

2) [b]Recruitment forum[/b]. Similar to SDL Jobs and Ogre Recruitment forum; request help on Urho3D-related projects and/or offer your skills. May include both paid & free work. Naturally any arrangements you negotiate are wholly on your own risk and not the responsibility of the forum admins / Urho3D team.

Note that neither forum would be meant for circumventing the forum rule of no unsolicited advertising. But you could showcase work where on-topic (eg. you offer yourself as an elite Urho3D shader author on recruitment forum; naturally you can then show your related work)

I think this will be great as it will make certain assets readily available for those who might want to test out ideas  :smiley: . But I guess checks and regulations would be put in place to insure that works shared are original and legal, with permissive license.

Yes, that's an important point to note (though it's already covered by the general forum rules) Basically if something fishy is posted, whoever notices it needs to notify the mods/admins and we'll deal with it.

An [b]Artist[/b] or art subforum would help organize topics, and I anticipated more of those coming.

A [b]Recruitment[/b] subforum: project and Urho3D developments are mutually beneficial, and this is probably the best place to facilitate that.

I fully support this. I had actually PM'd Cadaver previous about this, as I would take advantage of a Recruitment forum.

Sounds good. I'd suggest those posting recruitment offers to follow a simple title tag format, eg: [PAID], [UNPAID],[DEFERRED], etc. (where profit-share falls into deferred).

The new subforums should be live. I hope I set (copied) the permissions properly, so that you actually can post :wink: Thanks to everyone who offered their input!
