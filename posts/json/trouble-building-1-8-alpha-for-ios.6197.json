First, should you be able to use the CMAKE gui to create the Xcode build projects, or is this still a WIP given that it is alpha code? I have a lot of experience on Windows, but not so much with Mac OS and CMAKE, so I always struggle to get the initial projects built (for me, getting the projects to build is the hardest part of using Urho3D).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I run the CMAKE configure, I get some messages like below towards the end:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eCMake Warning (dev) at /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/share/cmake-3.17/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:272 (message):\n  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (rt) does\n  not match the name of the calling package (RT).
