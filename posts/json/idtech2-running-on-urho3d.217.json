This was a test and and a proof of concept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve wanted to make a game using idTech2 and learn GTKRadiant for a long time.  This prototype pushes that desire forward another notch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also worked a bunch on some Urho3D tech last winter including a Unity3D exporter (VIDEO: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3ehQwfbjGg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eyoutube.com/watch?v=m3ehQwfbjGg\u003c/a\u003e).  I have been working more on the Unity3D exporter and I think this will be a very good content path for Urho3D projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[size=120]Goals[/size]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA feature complete idTech2 renderer and platform layer built using Urho3D which supports both demo playback and actually playing Quake2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt needed support for transparency, animated lightmaps and world textures (lightstyles!), dynamic lights, alias morph models, water effetcts, particles, and moving/rotating brush models.  The parts that I haven’t gotten to being “beams” and some view blends.  However, dynamic lights casting shadows and Urho’s refracting water all working kind of make up for these \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to run on both OpenGL and Direct3D.

The biggest missing thing is that I didn’t hook up WAV loading/playback.

I also wanted to make sure idTech2 stayed intact without any core changes.  idTech2 has a nice rendering “plugin” system, so all the Urho3D stuff is completely opaque to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[size=120]Why idTech2?[/size]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eidTech2 solves a lot of really hard problems (which modern engines continue to struggle with) in a very elegant and small codebase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt has really smooth networked physics, excellent PVS and PHS support (which is still really important especially when doing \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003eper pixel lighting\u003c/span\u003e!), and is a game engine with working content pipeline and processing tools (GTKRadiant is still in use by major studios!).  This is an interesting review on idTech2: \u003ca href=\"http://fabiensanglard.net/quake2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003efabiensanglard.net/quake2\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[size=120]Why Urho3D?[/size]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrho3D is a fantastic engine, I really love working with it.  I think Urho is a great fit for indie developers due to its (extremely) clean design and relatively small footprint.  It also has excellent cross platform support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[size=120]What does the code look like?[/size]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is very much a prototype ATM: \u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/JoshEngebretson/fc08622b25f793fbe422\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003egist.github.com/JoshEngebretson … f793fbe422\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it is a quite small amount of code and would be easy to refactor it for OOP and for better Urho3D styling.

This wasn’t at the polygon level, however at the cluster level the PVS still breaks a level up pretty well.  The prototype runs well on my MBAir with an Intel HD3000, but this particular GPU is a bit underpowered so the PVS is actually super important when doing the per pixel lighting effects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can kind of see in the video that shadows are being cast, but the lighting is pretty fast paced in Quake2 so hard to see…  there is also support for lightmap styles, so lightmaps can flicker/pulse/turn on and off, etc.  It is awesome how well the lightmaps and realtime lights mix!  The refracting water effect you did is also really nice on water brushes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt every corner, Urho3D provided a way of handling something… Alias model? Use morphs!
