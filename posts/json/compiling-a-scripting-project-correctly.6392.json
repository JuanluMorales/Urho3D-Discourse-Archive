I followed \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/wiki/Getting-started-in-Linux\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e short guide and built urho with the lua flag. The binaries are there and work fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I‚Äôve been doing works (or seems to). I have a template that I use and like other engines/frameworks with lua, I type away and run Urho3DPlayer anytime I want. However, I want to distribute my projects the right way. What is the correct procedure here? The binary samples still require the Data folder, but neither of the script folders. So what are they exactly? Are they just urho3dplayer files that \u003cem\u003edon‚Äôt\u003c/em\u003e read commandline.txt? Or do they have certain files embedded in them? Is there C++ code compiled in those samples?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI‚Äôm using Geany to edit my scripts. Because I‚Äôve never needed to compile I have no idea how to set that up. Is there a guide anywhere for angelscript project distribution that I can read over? I found a wizard for codeblocks (which I don‚Äôt use) but it looked to be for windows. I should have some terminal commands to do, correct? Or, is it okay to distribute a project like I am? Am I supposed to be creating make files to build my project with only the necessary files? Currently, I‚Äôve just been stripping things down in a copied project folder, which has a Data folder etc and everything it needs to run all in a zip archive. I mean it works as a weird standalone thing, but I want to learn the proper way for lua and angelscript projects.
