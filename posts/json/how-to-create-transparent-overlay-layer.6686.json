The bottom layer Map is 100% opaque.  The airspaces however, where they overlap, should NOT blend, but instead the last-to-render should dominate.   See image included - it shows two airspaces, Gray \u0026amp; Red, which overlap.  But as you can see the Red Layer is dominant, and so where they overlap (circled in Blue pen), the transparency is ONLY RED (and NOT a blend between Red + Gray).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo achieve this, we’ve implemented an ugly HACK.  We placed a physical plane in 3D space in front of our camera, and then rendered these transparent objects to this Plane’s Texture (RTT) as 100% opaque (no blending).  Then we take the resulting plane, and render it to the Main Camera, using a shader that makes it only 40% opaque.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis kludge hack is ugly/kludging.
