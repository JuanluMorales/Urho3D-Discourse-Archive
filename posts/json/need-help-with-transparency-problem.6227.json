The cream colored plane is then behind the galaxy and it doesn’t show up except where it is in front of the galaxy, which has written to the depth buffer. If you draw the cream colored plane first then the galaxy always passes the depth test and blends with the plane behind it as you would expect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think you’re misunderstanding might be about how the transparency works. It’s all fake transparency (with the possible exception of alpha=0 pixels). All of the rendering is like painting - you add more and more layers to the image, but you can never insert a layer between the layers later. Transparency is an illusion created by choosing the appropriate color that blends between the existing color at the pixel and the new color based on alpha.

My only other experience with 3D rendering is Apple’s SceneKit.  With that I never had any issues with transparency not really being transparent.  SceneKit also does not seem to expose the concept of depthwrite so I never had to decide if it was true or false (I assume it was always true).  Things just worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn SceneKit I would set the rendering order of the galaxy plane to 128 and the bulge node to 129.

My galactic bulge and the deep sky objects (star clusters, galaxies, etc) and all managed using  BillboardSets.  They seem really efficient.  I would divide this objects into sets for the north galactic hemisphere and the south galactic hemisphere.  If the camera was in the north hemisphere looking down on the galaxy, I’d dra the southern objects first, then the galaxy, then the northern objects.  This does make the transparent corners of the galaxy image work correctly.  I now see the southern objects that were previously hidden by the black corners of the galaxy image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, I don’t think this will work in general.  Some of the billboards, even though small,  will end up spanning the two hemispheres.  So the corners of the billboard will look correct in one hemisphere, I will see black corners in the side the stick into the other hemisphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I mentioned before, with Apple’s SceneKit, this all just worked.  Are you absolutely sure there there is not some option to enable in Urho3D to make this work?  I would think that it would be possible to draw the galaxy first and then the output buffer would remember what pixels are transparent.  So when I later draw the other objects, the ones behind the transparent corners would show thorough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this is really the only way Urho3D can work, then I may have to abandon it.

performance).\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":7,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2020-07-06T18:15:30.311Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":6,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":17,"readers_count":16,"score":3.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":6227,"topic_slug":"need-help-with-transparency-problem","display_username":"SirNate0","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"reply_to_user":{"username":"btschumy","name":"Bill
