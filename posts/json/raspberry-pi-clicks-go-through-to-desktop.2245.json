To get around this I launch an empty Python Tkinter application behind the game to block the clicks. Although it works I feel like there has to be a better way to do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother (maybe related issue) is when booting the game if you move the mouse Raspbians cursor image gets caught above the game grapics so it looks like there are 2 cursors (the Urho cursor works fine)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone know how I could get around the problems?\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:14:12.747Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":3,"reads":4,"readers_count":3,"score":15.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":2245,"topic_slug":"raspberry-pi-clicks-go-through-to-desktop","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":320,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":13656,"name":"","username":"miz","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e0b2c6/{size}.png","created_at":"2016-09-19T14:19:37.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eIf anyone is following this I am currently investigating accessing x11 stuff from c++ and seeing if I can disable OS input that way.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:14:16.277Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":4,"readers_count":3,"score":0.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":2245,"topic_slug":"raspberry-pi-clicks-go-through-to-desktop","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":320,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":13661,"name":"魔大农 𝞍𝞎𝝳 現招蜍","username":"Modanung","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/modanung/{size}/3290_2.png","created_at":"2016-09-19T20:39:00.000Z","cooked":"\u003caside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"miz\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/e0b2c6/40.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003e miz:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf anyone is following this…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill definitely keep this topic in mind.

option I’ve found is something called xinput - it’s a command line tool that you can use to disable inputs so you can make a bash script that will use xinput to disable the inputs and open the game and then either call another bash script upon exiting the game to re-enable inputs or have some sort of thing running that checks whether the game process is still running and if it isn’t enables the inputs again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso xinput is source code is available online and written in C so I’m also digging around to see what it’s actually doing to see if I can do something
