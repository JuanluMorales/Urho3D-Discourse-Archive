Yesterday I tried to start and run the engine without any of the file-based resources that come with Urho3D. That involves setting up the render path manually, also creating geometries and shaders on the fly. It works, but the API doesn’t make it easy for people to use the engine from scratch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere’s a few suggestions that would help a lot with gaining control of the API without adding much overhead for the API user:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDitch the current prefix / data paths setup.\u003cbr\u003e\nIs the extra code of having to write cache-\u0026gt;AddResourceDir(mypath) really worth reducing flexibility over? I suggest a build time const char * or define that holds the Urho3D data home. It CAN be used, but\u003cbr\u003e\nnobody is forced to use it. Thusly, the exact same thing done by the engine parameters could be done in Setup with cache-\u0026gt;AddResourceDir(URHO3D_DEFAULT_PATH + “/Data”)\u003cbr\u003e\nand cache-\u0026gt;AddResourceDir(URHO3D_DEFAULT_PATH + “/CoreData”). Two lines of code to replace the enigne parameters and the sort of messy code in Engine::Initialize. You could also ditch the whole “prefix” and “actual\u003cbr\u003e\npath” separation, this is bread and butter code, we don’t need the engine to handle this. (also Urho3D provides nice portable filesystem features, so all in all this is better to leave to the user)\u003cbr\u003e\nTrying to figure out every use case is impossible, so I’m better of finding and adding my own resource directories as I please and also handle possible errors. At worse, the poor user must write two lines of code to replace\u003cbr\u003e\neverything that’s automagic through engine parameters and Initialize right now.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis would also help with the ridiculous install policy to put data in $PREFIX/bin (it should be in $PREFIX/share), the sample binaries should use the URHO3D_DEFAULT_PATH as set during Urho3D build to know where the data is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDefault render path, textures, style and UI should NOT be loaded automatically.\u003cbr\u003e\nAgain, what if I don’t want to use them? Try to break this out into a separate call after the engine has been initialized, it will also allow the user to\u003cbr\u003e\ncatch missing file errors and react accordingly, perhaps add more resource dirs or whatever. No reason to limit the API usability for this tiny extra bit of automagic.\u003cbr\u003e\nPerhaps just add a convencience call like Engine::InitializeDefaultResources, but really, I think users should explicitly have to load the resources. It’s 6 lines of code you’re saving us from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRenderPath needs helper methods to create or set specific RenderPathCommand’s. Right now it’s a pain to set up a 7 command render pass manually. It wouldn’t hurt if there was a way to “zero” it or maybe a const somewhere\u003cbr\u003e\nwith an empty, like RenderPathCommand::EMPTY.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you for taking time to read through all of that.

Before yesterday, the runtime install destination was “share/Urho3D/Bin”. This destination was used for both the target executables and resource dirs  (CoreData and Data). There was no “resource prefix path” engine parametr back then, so both target executables and resource dirs had to be installed in a same location previously. This was exactly the reason why we had chosen to install to “share/Urho3D/Bin” instead of “bin” in the first place. But since now we have introduced the “resource prefix path” engine parameter in the new build system, it opens up the possibility to have the target executables and the resource dirs to be installed in different location. It also opens the possibility for the Mac OS X Bundle build option. It was a simply mistake on my part yesterday when I change the runtime install destination for the target executables to “bin”, without readjusting the install destination for the resource dirs so the resource dirs got installed to “bin” too (which was bad, of course).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRe. Putting the resource prefix path as a constant in the C++ code. Personally, I like our current way better. It has proven to work for all the use cases and platforms. If you want to hard-wired the resource path in your own project, you can also do so with our current code. I.e by initializing the engine parameter statically in your code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the rest of your points, I think you have to wait for the engine author to respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEDIT: it looks like he already did \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":3,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:02:45.963Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":11,"readers_count":10,"score":2.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":767,"topic_slug":"proper-directory-and-resource-management","display_username":"Yao Wei Tjong","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"Admin","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":4,"hidden":false,"trust_level":4,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":4205,"name":"","username":"Spongie","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/8e8cbc/{size}.png","created_at":"2015-01-19T15:51:45.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eHey. Thanks for quick replies. You guys are amazing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Putting the resource prefix path as a constant in the C++ code. Personally, I like our current way better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s just the system default that was used at build time, you don’t have to use it. You can still use your own environment variables, configurations or even hardcoded engine parameters. This is how things have traditionally been done to handle default paths for a system. It’s nothing special, it’s like a version string or whatever. And it’s not a prefix path anymore, it’s just a resource directory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the more flexible aproach to handling paths and resource loading, I got rid of all the defaults and wrote my own render path and shaders. It works, but I have to work against the API and abuse somewhat instead of working with it.\u003cbr\u003e\nNot all projects must be file resource dependent, Urho3D is already well designed enough to allow me to do this, just a few minor API changes really, no new work on the use flow/cases needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can make both use cases (either you want to load default resources or you don’t) very easy by accomodating some of the points I made. Save ~9 lines of code to get the defaults up and working, this would be an OK “compromise” between the “boxed in framework” and a regular API.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEDIT: and yes, you can define the XML as a literal string, that would be an acceptable form of creating render paths on the fly. Same with any other resource that works the same way.
