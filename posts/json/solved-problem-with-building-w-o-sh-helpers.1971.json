But, in order to properly work with IDE (Qt Creator or Clion), it needs bare cmake to be run and generate build files.\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd here is the cmake error -  while i trying to import my project into QtCreator - \u003cspan class=\"spoiler\"\u003e~/Build/Urho3D-Android-Build/\"aa\"\u003cbr\u003e\nCMake Error at CMake/Modules/FindUrho3D.cmake:356 (message):\u003cbr\u003e\nCould NOT find compatible Urho3D library in Urho3D SDK installation or\u003cbr\u003e\nbuild tree.

Those IDE rely on CMake to generate the project but yet they do not provide a way to select which CMake generator and which CMake toolchain files to use.

Once a generator is chosen and the project file is generated initially then it does not allow it to be changed. Not unless you reset its cache and regenerate the project from scratch again. I have not tried it with Qt Creator yet, but at least in CLion the IDE provides a way to reset the cache and reload project (more like regenerate the project actually) with a single click of a button.
