Currently every features of Tiled v0.9.1 are supported (see [url]http://www.mapeditor.org/download.html#changes[/url] for details).
This means that all features that have been introduced a couple of months ago in v0.10 are not available (animations, rotations...)

Also check Tile maps documentation ([url]http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_urho2_d.html[/url]).
