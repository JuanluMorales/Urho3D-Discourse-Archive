To get you started quickly, I think you are better of first running 11_Physics or 13_Ragdolls sample apps, pressing F7 to save the scene, exiting sample app, launching again Editor app, loading back the newly saved scene XML file in the editor. From there you can use the attribute inspector to inspect all the attributes of the selected node or component, then modify their attribute values, adding new node/component or deleting existing node/component to see what it does.
