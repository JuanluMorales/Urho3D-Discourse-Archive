For some reason when I’m clicking on things in game the OS cursor is not disabled so upon closing the game I find I’ve opened all sorts of windows and written long strings of w, a, s and d in all of them.

We have erroneously still relied on X11 stack for the input event handling. We thought we do not use any of X11 subystem already. We only find out about this bug in our recent work to migrate to SDL 2.0.4. In the new SDL-2.0.4-upgrade branch we have tried to rectify this. In the new branch you will need to have additional libevdev2 development library (if you are using Raspbian) installed before building the Urho3D. Unfortunately though the new branch is not yet ready. So, YMMV if you attempt to check it out now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlternatively, if you cannot wait then you can try to manually edit the Source/ThirdParty/SDL/include/SDL_config_linux.h to disable all of these below. In our current implementation in the master branch, this file is being shared by Linux and RPI, so we could not safely do that, but instead we could probably disable them conditionally when targeting RPI. But since the merging of SDL-2.0.4-upgrade branch is imminent, we will probably not do this fix now in the master branch.
