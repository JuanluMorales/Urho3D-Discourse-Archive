I have seen this used with other popular multiplayer games so aside from Client Side Prediction, I think transferring 'Host' status/mode during an active session to another 'Candidate' player with an acceptable ping rate (depending on the game) seems to be a good addition. This is particularly essential when the current host suddenly rage quits, drops out of the game or has some form of problem with his/her connection. The network session would run smoothly and avoid critical game play disruption.
