Hello everyone!

I'm trying to develop a basic "click on terrain to do something" feature to my game. Everything is working as expected, but I can't seem to figure out how can I properly test this in the editor, as the camera I'm using to do the screen point to world transformation is not the camera the editor uses to inspect the scene.

How can I get an instance to the editor's camera?

Thank you!
