The display went completely black although you could hear the Ninja demo clearly running in the background. Alt Tabbing to a window created a display and exiting the application showed the last rendered frame before the application terminated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSolution\u003c/strong\u003e: The problem was resolved when I did a ‘sudo apt-get install libgles2-mesa-dev libxt-dev libxaw7-dev’ ‘sudo apt-get install nvidia-cg-toolkit libsdl2-dev doxygen’ (steps found on an Ogre3D build guide website), ran cmake_generic.sh and ran make again. I suspect it was the libsdl2-dev that actually corrected the issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know if this will help anyone out, if you have this issue though perhaps it will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRook\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2019-12-06T11:03:44.295Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":245,"reads":34,"readers_count":33,"score":1251.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":5754,"topic_slug":"quick-tip-linux-ubuntu-screen-display-goes-black-in-fullscreen-solved","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":2,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":2}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1284,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false}],"stream":[34572]},"timeline_lookup":[[1,1083]],"suggested_topics":[{"id":7262,"title":"iOS
