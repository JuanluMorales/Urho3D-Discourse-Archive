Anyway, I don’t see any reason why our build system could not play nicely with QtCreator IDE. I am not a big fan of Qt but I had tested the QtCreator briefly in the past. If I recall correctly the QtCreator IDE basically just uses CMake/Code::Block generator to generate a project’s build tree and uses MinGW as the compiler toolchain. And the fact is our build system supports MinGW rather quite well, both on Windows and Linux host systems. The only problem I can think of is different vendor seems to build and bundle MinGW compiler toolchain slightly differently and may have different dependencies to the version of “d3compiler.dll” depending on which “libd3dcompiler(_xx).a” is being used in the build. Sorry if this does not help you much.
