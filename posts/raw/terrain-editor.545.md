A couple of weeks ago I read a thread (which I cant find now) mentioning some work on terrain edition tools. Whats the state of that work? Is there going to be terrain modification features any time soon?

Are you referring to this PR? [github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/436](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/pull/436)
The pull requester has not committed anything in the last few months.
