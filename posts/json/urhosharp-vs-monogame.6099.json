The map view is currently all written with 2D graphics calls.   We are about to convert our whole app over to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eXamarin.Forms — for UWP, iOS, and Android.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePlus - something that provides OpenGL support (D3D fine too).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur two chief alternatives are UrhoSharp or MonoGame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich is better and why?   Factors we’re considering:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOverall Community Support.  Namely which one has more users, who can help “show the way” for various things.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDeveloper support - which one is most likely to be supported for bug fixes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStability / Reliability - need it near 100%.  No mystery crashes; limited weird behavior.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFootprint - light weight is better.  We’re only doing simple graphics.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnything else I missed?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, my experience with Urho has been spotty.  So much stuff doesn’t work out-of-box for UWP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worst part about Uhro so far is the absence of Sample Code projects.   For example, I’ve spent a couple hours trying to find a downloadable “Custom Shader” example.  The one packaged with the UrhoSharp2019Samples.zip we found:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOmits the Custom Shader example for UWP (because it only has GLSL shader in the sample)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAnd the Custom Shader doesn’t render for Android (not sure on iOS).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t find any working online projects for CustomShader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent a few hours trying to get Anti-Aliasing to work … and ends up I have to use the FXAA2 post shader, which also DOES NOT WORK on UWP, unless you turn on HDR Lighting (so why didn’t the sample code have it set up this way to start with?).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyhow – there have been a lot of landmines from the get-go, and I’m having hard time finding example code online. (where you just download a zip file, and see it run out-of-box, and then tweak the code to learn it)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were favoring Urho3D so far – but have been somewhat disappointed with what we’re finding, enough so that we’re now wondering if we might be better off with MonoGame instead… ?\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2020-04-19T19:00:06.854Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":128,"reads":45,"readers_count":44,"score":649.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":6099,"topic_slug":"urhosharp-vs-monogame","display_username":"Brian Knox","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1334,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":37441,"name":"J Tippetts","username":"JTippetts1","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/jtippetts1/{size}/96_2.png","created_at":"2020-04-19T21:26:10.346Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eIt is my understanding that UrhoSharp is a dead project.
