achieve the effect you want by modifying the Skybox fragment shader to render a mix of the skybox texture and the geometry already rendered. You need to read the depth buffer and then set the skybox transparency inversely proportional to the depth value, so that the skybox is completely transparent close by and opaque far away and a range in between. This means you don’t need the Fog effect build in Urho and should disable it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem with this is that the skybox is rendered last (I think) in the opaque pass, so the effect will not work for transparent objects which are rendered afterwards.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":10,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2020-02-01T09:02:59.052Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":2,"reads":29,"readers_count":28,"score":65.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":5854,"topic_slug":"fog-transparency-problem-with-skybox","display_username":"QB'k Games","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":3}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":780,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":35203,"name":"","username":"dev4fun","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/d/58f4c7/{size}.png","created_at":"2020-02-02T02:45:23.969Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eHmm good solution, thanks for idea.
