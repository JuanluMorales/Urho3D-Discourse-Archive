At least now they’re deleted and the error message will be more clear if you attempt the same with a master version of the code \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/blob/master/Source/Urho3D/Container/Ptr.h#L531\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttps://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/blob/master/Source/Urho3D/Container/Ptr.h#L531\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd also, this might not true:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-cpp\"\u003eUniquePtr\u0026lt;Thing\u0026gt; thing;\nthing.Reset(new Thing());\n...\nVector\u0026lt;UniquePtr\u0026lt;Thing\u0026gt;\u0026gt; things = Vector\u0026lt;UniquePtr\u0026lt;Thing\u0026gt;\u0026gt;();\nthings.Push(thing); //From my understanding, move semantics will transfer ownership from \"thing\" to the vector\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause \u003ccode\u003ething\u003c/code\u003e is an lvalue, and unless the compiler tries to be smart (\u003cem\u003eor dumb if you think about it\u003c/em\u003e), it shouldn’t try to move that lvalue unless explicitly specified.

Isn’t \u003ccode\u003ething\u003c/code\u003e left in an unusable state after a move has taken place?

I believe you’ve either omitted some details, the compiler wen’t crazy somehow or is just bad at reporting errors. Because it does not make sense in that context.
