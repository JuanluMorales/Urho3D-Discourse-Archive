Hi, all!

What would be most elegant solution to do the following:

I have an image, representing human in T-pose, and want the body parts to be clickable.
I need to have this in UI and work as bone selection tool for ragdoll editor, as standard widgets are too
tedious to use in this case. I want user to select bone on actual model, then window appears which shows
various settings including this picture widget, where it should be possible to select which ragdoll bone current
selected bone corresponds to (which allows less work making ragdolls).
Any ideas? I use AngelScript for the tool.
