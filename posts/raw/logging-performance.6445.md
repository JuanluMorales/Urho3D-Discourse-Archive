I recently started adding Urho3D logging to my projects, and noticed a significant overhead from log levels that weren't even active (in a test case that was pounding away at something). [EDIT: I checked and there is a ton of overhead just calling `Urho3D::ToString()` to convert a formatted C-style log message to an `Urho3D::String`... which never gets used.]

Basically the compiler isn't getting rid of log lines that don't do anything. I'm wondering if it would make more sense to define log levels in the build system and `#ifdef` away all the unneeded log lines in `Urho3D/IO/Log.h`. Or maybe I am misusing logging... Interested in anyone's thoughts.

I'd certainly be fine with that approach, but I'd prefer it as a `#define MAX_LOG_LEVEL`, while still allowing runtime setting of the log level below that. That way apps can have a verbose/debug setting that the user can enable, but you could still achieve what you want (the compiler removing all the extra calls).

Another approach might be too see about making String constexpr, but I'm no expert on that.

Do you you mean that you want per-level defines instead of global?

@Eugene they are only removed if logging is completely disabled. I am looking for a more fine-tuned approach that only executes log statements when they are actually used.

@SirNate0  `ToString()` is only executed for formatted log messages, which are evaluated at run time.

In Java/Kotlin with Log4J pattern, computationally expensive string construction for the logging should be guarded inside the `isXXXEnabled()`. e.g.:

    if (isDebugEnabled()) {
        // Construct the expensive string here
        val expensiveString = .....
        logger.debug(expensiveString)
    }

Although Urho3D API does not provide such guard methods, it does provide the `GetLevel()` method to do the equivalent.

The problem with `GetLevel()` is you'd need to add a static `GetLevelStatic()` for accessing the logging singleton, which implies a mandatory indirection `logInstance->GetLevel()`, if you want to do something like
```
#define URHO3D_LOGTRACEF(format, ...) GetLevelStatic() <= LOG_TRACE ? Write(LOG_TRACE, ToString(...)) : (void)0
```

@weitjong I am trying to add a `URHO3D_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` input to the build system for logging, but can't quite get it to work. Here are relevant parts of the diff

Not all strings are expensive to construct. Most are just constant which cost nothing during runtime. So usually I peppered the check in my code at the place where I need it where the logger object is already known.

Back to your question. You basically wants to bake the level when building the engine itself. I donâ€™t think that is the right direction. But i wonâ€™t stop you. You have to be more explicit on what was the errors you encountered if you need my help.

I want to bake the level when building a project, not the engine. For example I have two build scripts with `-DURHO3D_PROFILING=ON/OFF` for debug/release builds of my project. Don't need to rebuild the library. I could be misunderstanding things though. Yes, I probably am... hmm
