Lets say I have a board with a frame and some fields. Position of these fields changes depending on texture loaded. A simple example would be chess board and pawn on top of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow should I get the coordinates of face below the field to place another model on top of it? I have been thinking about defining the coordinates of field position in texture, and than finding model vertices related.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow can i get texture coordinates from static model?  Maybe a solution already exists to find a polygon under a specific point of texture?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny help on this problem would be greatly appreciated!\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:04:03.024Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":18,"reads":6,"readers_count":5,"score":91.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":911,"topic_slug":"model-element-coordinates","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":216,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":5253,"name":"","username":"thebluefish","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/t/f04885/{size}.png","created_at":"2015-03-08T15:23:27.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eA 3D model is just some art, nothing more.

Never though of it that way. Seems to be really easy solution for a chess board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, what if we would take a chest as an example. One model and several areas for interaction (e.g. key hole, 4 latches) Where each latch could act differently on the chest, findind where did we touch isnt a problem, the question is which part of texture was actually in the touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could define parts in texture (e.g point 20,20 to 40,40 is a latch no 1., in other case 35,20 to 55,40 is a latch no 1), they can vary (the same model, different texture means different places)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have been thinking about such solution in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreate a chest model, add 4 polygons (seperate models), export it from maya. Load the model into a StaticModel it would give me a model with 5 geometries, 4 of them would represent the transparent polygons and 5th one a visible model. Can i somehow pull the geometries by names as named in maya? Looking at the *.mdl file i dont think so as the names of meshes arent exported. I could still base on the amount of vertices to find related geometries, however it still doesnt sort the problem of latches order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really dont want to over complicate the problem, but i cant seems to figure it out. I get your idea, cant think how to apply it in this case. would defining an offset from the center and size of each latch for each texture be the easiest
