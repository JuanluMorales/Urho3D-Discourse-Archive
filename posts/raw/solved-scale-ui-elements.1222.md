Hello everyone,

When I test the UI sample on my phone, I found the UI looks so tiny, I wish all the elements(button,image,dropbox...) become larger, even the border become (eg button's) thicker.

What's the proper way to do so? Or I should redefine all of the elemnts and modify all of the textures?

thanks

You could try planning your UI elements on how big would you like them to appear on your layout screen, then create a function to compute the dimensions and scale them before displaying on screen.
