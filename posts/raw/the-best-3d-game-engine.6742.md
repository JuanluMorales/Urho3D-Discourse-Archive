Godot has a [visual scripting system](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/visual_script/getting_started.html) and it's based on it's already simple scripting language. Unreal engine has blueprints, but they're not designed to be stand alone. CryEngine has one too I think? never tried that.
You might want to learn a programming language either way like lua or python or C#. It's a useful skill to have :).

Or maybe start with some [Processing](https://processing.org), to familiarize yourself the basics. It comes with a simple IDE, is easy to set up and brings immediate graphical results.
