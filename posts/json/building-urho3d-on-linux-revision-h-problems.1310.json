Another minor mistake was turning on the URHO3D_STATIC_RUNTIME option on Linux build.

Also, there is no need for you to explicitly turn on the URHO3D_C++11 option, at least for now. Urho3D library code base does not not rely on any C++11 standard (yet). The C++11 standard is only required by one of the 3rd party library (nanodbc) when database subsystem is enabled for the build, so it gets turn on implicitly only when it is needed.
