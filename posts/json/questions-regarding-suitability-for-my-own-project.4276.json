The co-ordinate system I’m required to use for compatibility with the Source engine is X-right Y-forward Z-up. Would it be feasible to somehow use/coerce this within the Urho3d engine? I have before in other code used a final transform just before projection to flip the latter two axes, but I suspect this wouldn’t play nicely with Euler angles since pitch and yaw would end up being swapped too.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDoes the engine have high DPI support? I’ve tried the samples on my MacBook and the UI is rather small in many of them. Alternatively, would there be support to just run the engine in a lower resolution and scale the resulting frames up at a window manager level?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThis one’s not so critical, but is there any support (or would support be planned) for multi-window functionality? It’d be nice to be able to spawn off sub-windows belonging to the engine so that I can take advantage of multiple monitors.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2018-05-31T21:08:45.119Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":2,"reads":43,"readers_count":42,"score":23.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":4276,"topic_slug":"questions-regarding-suitability-for-my-own-project","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":991,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":24736,"name":"kabu","username":"johnnycable","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/johnnycable/{size}/788_2.png","created_at":"2018-06-01T19:17:37.573Z","cooked":"\u003caside class=\"quote no-group\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"4276\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/x6herbius/40/1488_1.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003e x6herbius:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes the engine have high DPI support?

I don’t want the user to even have to know that there are two co-ordinate systems (it’s confusing enough for me converting between the two), so I’d need to allow them to work only in the Z-up system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring the Y-up convention, working as if Z were up and then applying a pre-projection transformation to flip back to OpenGL’s system would work as far as the scene is concerned, because I’ve done it before. However, it does mean that Euler angles would still be applied as if Y were up, resulting in pitch and yaw affecting the opposite axes to the ones that they should in a Z-up system. I did take a look at the engine code to see whether anything could be done about this, but due to the fact that vectors are used interchangeably for Euler angles, and that there’s no encapsulation on the X/Y/Z components, it doesn’t look like it’d be easy to change the behaviour of Euler angles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, objects in the engine that assume internally that the co-ordinate system is Y-up (the most significant example being cameras) would continue to do so, even though the scene itself would not correspond to that co-ordinate system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDPI-wise, I’ll have a look at that pull request and see if it’s something I can test on my Mac.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":4,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2018-06-02T10:28:24.348Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":3,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":37,"readers_count":36,"score":7.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":4276,"topic_slug":"questions-regarding-suitability-for-my-own-project","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"reply_to_user":{"username":"hdunderscore","name":"hd_","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/hdunderscore/{size}/1151_2.png"},"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":991,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":24747,"name":"SirNate0","username":"SirNate0","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/9f8e36/{size}.png","created_at":"2018-06-02T13:36:31.756Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eIf the users won’t be touching the code (i.e. they will never create our use a Vector3 directly but only see them in UI and logs and how you label axes) you can probably just convert to Urho’s system on import and back on export and then in all of your UI’s print vectors as “X: {v.x_} Y: {v.z_} Z: {v.y_}” and then do a similar trick to negate the Euler angles if needed (positive angles are probably opposite of what the users are used to).\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":5,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2018-06-02T13:36:31.756Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":34,"readers_count":33,"score":6.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":4276,"topic_slug":"questions-regarding-suitability-for-my-own-project","display_username":"SirNate0","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":628,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":24761,"name":"","username":"x6herbius","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/x6herbius/{size}/1488_2.png","created_at":"2018-06-03T20:17:06.759Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eNot quite sure why the last post was withdrawn, I read the e-mail notification for it and it was quite informative.
