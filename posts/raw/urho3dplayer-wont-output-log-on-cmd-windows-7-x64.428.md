I started to use AngelScript using Urho3DPlayer. But one thing that bother me, I can't see output log or error on my command line. Print() function doesn't display anything too. I use Windows 7 x64. 

If I run script with this command on cmd:
[code]Urho3dPlayer.exe Data\Scripts\MyScript.as[/code]Cmd just run Urho3DPlayer and won't halt outputting log like if I use Linux. Cmd will continue to accept command like nothing happens despite Urho3dPlayer is running. 

What happens? Do I need to set something?
