I newbie in frameworks and CB. Sorry for my stupidness.
I did everything as in tutorial: cmake, make, cmake_codeblocks.sh. But i don't undestand how create a project. Cmake_codeblocks.sh create project file in engine root folder (it's wrong?) and his structure different than in tutorial.
Update: I create project by this tutorial https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/wiki/Setting-up-a-Project-(CMake), but i receive error: "post_cmake: command not found".

Hello,

Learning new stuff-- no apologies there. :slight_smile: I can't speak on the wiki article but https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_building.html and https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_using_library.html
are most relevant.

If CodeBlocks project generator is not working, an issue can be filed. I usually use Makefiles generator instead.
