I am using the PhysicsStressTest example script ( [url]https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/blob/master/bin/Data/LuaScripts/12_PhysicsStressTest.lua[/url] ) and I am trying to modify the "[b]SpawnObject( )[/b]" function ( Line #216 ) to make the SmallBoxes bounce like a Tennis Ball or a Rubber Super Bouncy Ball.  In the end; I'll be using my own sphereical models in place of the SmallBoxes.

1: Tennis Ball / Basket Ball

2: Rubber Super Bouncy Ball ( like you buy for 25 - 50 cents at a store's/laundry_mat's kids toys dispencing machine )

I thought about using: [i][u] body.restitution [/u][/i] but I don't know how to adjust that and/or the [i][u] body.mass [/u][/i] and/or the [u][i] body.friction [/i][/u] to accomplish a big bounce.
