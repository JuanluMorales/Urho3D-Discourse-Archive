Hello. Last christmas I became obsessed with a popular multiplayer survival shooter game. Since my laptop could barely run it I decided to write a "low-end" clone of it, that's how this project got started. I've been working on it intermittently since then and have been wanting to show it somewhere. Checked some of the other showcased games and it seems no one expects finished products here. I've made two videos showcasing pretty much everything you can do in the game so far, which I now realise really isn't much...

Here are the videos

More or less everything is made by me, some graphics I've found on opengameart.com (icons, trees), I made the rest. I am aware of how **awful** everything looks, but I haven't been focusing on making things look nice, more like the opposite, trying to make the game run on a really old laptop (hence adding the awful LOD you might see).

EDIT: I would love to playtest this with someone, it is multiplayer, but I have never tried it with another person.

this is very cool. i'd like to see it progress further. i'm also a fan of a certain survival game, which also doesn't like my laptop very much.

and frankly, lod is probably the only major difference. certain other survival game ...sort of just kept adding content after they reached this level of mechanics, and it's absurdly popular. this could be a really fun (and successful) game, don't lose your positivity about it. ðŸ˜‰

edit: I would like to try it, and I have a buddy that i'm sure would also.

thanks for your reply glitch-method. nice to see someone thinks positively about it. i haven't worked on it for a while now, and i ended up splitting it into 2 separate projects this spring. maybe i'll go back to it. there has been a lot of progress on both projects. i guess i will post it here soon, if i can find my screenshots.

would also be great if someone wanted to test it. right this moment i am busy with studying but in a few weeks i might start again.
