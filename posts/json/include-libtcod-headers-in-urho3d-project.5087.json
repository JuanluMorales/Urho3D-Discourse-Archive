To be precise, I don’t want to compile Libtcod as a built in third party lib (I mean, like Bullet or FreeType, etc.). I just want to use it with an already set up project. So, I’ve found a solution in making FindLibtcod.cmake and FindLibtcodxx.cmake modules and by including the following lines in my CMakeLists.txt:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003efind_package(Libtcod REQUIRED)\ninclude_directories(${LIBTCOD_INCLUDE_DIRS})\nset(LIBS ${LIBS} ${LIBTCOD_LIBRARIES})\n\nfind_package(Libtcodxx REQUIRED)\ninclude_directories(${LIBTCODXX_INCLUDE_DIRS})\nset(LIBS ${LIBS} ${LIBTCODXX_LIBRARIES})\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve kind of copy pasted Cmake module finders from the internet and follow the instructions here \u003ca href=\"https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/wikis/doc/tutorials/How-To-Find-Libraries\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttps://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/wikis/doc/tutorials/How-To-Find-Libraries\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, I find \u003cem\u003eBuilding Urho3D library\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eUsing Urho3D library\u003c/em\u003e especially daunting for the newcomers. What is more, I have an impression that topics are not well separated in the sense that already the first mentioned page (\u003cem\u003eBuilding Urho3D library\u003c/em\u003e) is actually talking about build scripts, which are, actually, used not to build Urho3D library, but to create a project based on Urho3D, and that means that the heading \u003cstrong\u003eBuild scripts\u003c/strong\u003e belongs rather to the second page of the documentation (\u003cem\u003eUsing Urho3D library\u003c/em\u003e). Also, I’ve needed quite few trial and error and search on the internet just to figure out that \u003cstrong\u003eBuild options\u003c/strong\u003e is related to the personal project build options and not to the building of the Urho3D library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I’ve got through the initial pain, mostly by looking around on the internet how to set up an initial and barebones project. IMHO, we need to have some official tutorials for the major systems, like Windows 10, Ubuntu and OS X. I know quite well that it’s easier said than done and that people are working hard and contributing a lot. Nevertheless, it seems to like a priority.
