You can just build your controllers as components, and subscribe them to listen for the PhysicsPreStep (E_PHYSICSPRESTEP) event, which occurs right before the physics update. They can then issue whatever orders they need to their owning object in a self-contained manner, without having an external system handling it all. I recently did a blog post on a third-person rpg camera system I implemented for some of my projects ( \u003ca href=\"http://www.gamedev.net/blog/33/entry-2259326-demo-and-explanation-of-third-person-camera/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003egamedev.net/blog/33/entry-22 … on-camera/\u003c/a\u003e ) that includes a demo in Lua. The demo implements a very simple RPG-type level with a camera that has a number of options. The demo includes 2 player controllers: 1 that allows point-and-click, Diablo-style movement with pathfinding, and the other (commented out in the object instance section in levelgenerator.lua, but you can uncomment it and comment out the other) that implements WASD-style movement. They are implemented as ScriptObject components that do their work during Update. There is also a random-wander AI controller as well assigned to a handful of AI units. Each controller is a self-contained component that is instanced into a node to provide that node with the desired behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my opinion, you should try to implement everything within the game as components attached to nodes; subsystems should only be done if something needs to be visible to many different objects globally, rather than being local to the object as a player or AI controller is. My personal preference is to do \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003eeverything\u003c/span\u003e as components; and if something requires subsystem-type behavior, do it as a scene-level component similar to PhysicsWorld, Octree, NavigationMesh, etc…\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":5,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T00:58:09.560Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":5,"readers_count":4,"score":1.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":117,"topic_slug":"ai-implementation","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://www.gamedev.net/blog/33/entry-2259326-demo-and-explanation-of-third-person-camera/","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Demo and Explanation of Third Person Camera - GameDev.net","clicks":1}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":30,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":585,"name":"","username":"NemesisFS","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/n/d2c977/{size}.png","created_at":"2014-03-03T14:49:36.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eI`ll think I will use that approach, thanks JTippetts.\u003cbr\u003e\nThough I propably will use a controller with plugable strategies which it will then evaluate for the input.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eedit:\u003cbr\u003e\nwhat events should I listen to? the AI will need to be executed before the “space-ship-component” applies its forces.
