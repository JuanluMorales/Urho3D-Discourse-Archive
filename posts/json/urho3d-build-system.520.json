I’m a 32 years old developer, with 15+ years of experience in various languages (Mostly C++), but with close to no experience in the gaming branch. That’s it \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo i’m trying Urho3D on a Mac OSX based operating system, and i’ve got a few questions / remarks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003e1) Generating a reusable framework\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen building from source, i’m unable to get something clean / functionnal as a re-usable framework. i tried many different CMake configurations, to finally just remove everything because none of them was usable:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea) When generating XCode project, it’s close to impossible to get a “Release” build of the framework, because the 93 targets are by default using the “Debug” configuration, even when archiving (By default, it should be the “Release” configuration that is used in all target for the “Archive” action). How do you guys generate a “Release” build of the framework that you can then link against from a \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003efresh and from scratch project, itself not necessarily using cmake\u003c/span\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eb) When building via the Unix Makefiles, the generated things are spread all around the source tree… Which is confusing, because some binaries replace previously generated ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ec) In any case, if i start a new project from scratch (Empty XCode project, compiling a single “main.cpp” file), it’s impossible to link against the framework. i have set the headers search path to my built SDK include directory, but the files inside are trying to include more files without using the correct file paths (Eg \u003cspan class=\"hashtag\"\u003e#include\u003c/span\u003e “SDL_Joystick.h” instead of \u003cspan class=\"hashtag\"\u003e#include\u003c/span\u003e “SDL/SDL_Joystick.h”).\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is IMO a design mistake. So one thing leading to another, i have set the include paths to be recursive, but there, it won’t compile, because some classes are missing (Basically, it would probably compile from the source tree because the \u003cspan class=\"hashtag\"\u003e#include\u003c/span\u003e order are correct, but not from my “fresh” project). This denotes a “\u003cspan class=\"hashtag\"\u003e#include\u003c/span\u003e” hell that probably needs to be worked on a bit.\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom my code, i get errors also, because some headers from the framework are probably doing some forward-class declaration for some public members pointers. This leads to me being unable to compile the project without having to include the headers file that should have be included in the first place by the framework headers themselve. Eg take the HelloWorld sample along with the Sample parent class, put the files in a fresh project, try to compile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003e2) Compiling for iOS\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHere, it’s a nightmare to me, there must be something i don’t understand. Again, i have tried every single possibility of combination for CMake variables, with no joy (The XCode projects that are generated by CMake all ask to build a “Debug” version where it should be “Release”). Any pointers please? i really would love to have a clean XCode project that just builds Urho3D along with it’s dependencies, that i can drag\u0026amp;n\u0026amp;drop to my project, and be able to have an iOS target along with a MacX target within the same project (Gameplay3D does that quite nicely).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003e3) Contributing\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHaving a very strong background in C / C++ development and project management, i would like to know how to contribute to the project. I believe i would be able to solve this \u003cspan class=\"hashtag\"\u003e#include\u003c/span\u003e hell, and provide with a slicker API for people to link / build against. Any project maintainer around to tell me where to start?\u003cbr\u003e\n[edit]I have authored many Qt-based projects, all portable, so i’m very familiar with the linking differences when working with VS+nmake vs Unix etc, i have a very good understanding about how to provide a very opaque API with clean headers set for either a static or a dynamic library, etc.[/edit]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust before trying Urho3D, i tried GamePlay3D, which is not an option for the projects i plan to work on for various reasons that i won’t go into detail here. However, the build system used by GamePlay3D is very concise, i was able to build a project from scratch and play with many of their subsystem in less than 5mn, while i’m still struggling to fix some small issues (Which really are not related to the code itself, but more to how it’s being lay around in the directory structure) in Urho3D. I really think that’s a pity for a framework that appears to be so rich, because it can easily scare newcomers. Do you guys have any remark / suggestions for me regarding this matter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks a lot,\u003cbr\u003e\nDoodloo.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:01:04.336Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":153,"reads":42,"readers_count":41,"score":773.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":520,"topic_slug":"urho3d-build-system","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://discourse.urho3d.io/t/cmake-fixes/104/10","internal":true,"reflection":true,"title":"CMake fixes","clicks":0}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":154,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":2882,"name":"Yao Wei Tjong","username":"weitjong","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/weitjong/{size}/4_2.png","created_at":"2014-11-03T02:27:49.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eWelcome to our forum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think we have a few new users who come before you also made the same mistake, invoking CMake without using our provided shell/batch scripts or invoking cmake-gui without first reading the documentation. As the main maintainer of the build scripts, I can say our CMake build scripts are not perfect yet and they have been written with assumptions which are only hold true when you use the CMake build scripts as per their original designed or documented use cases. Most new users have mistakenly generated a non out-of-source build tree which is not supported anymore by our CMake build scripts, so the generated project would most likely end up in some kind of build failures (Android build on Windows host system without MKLINK build option is the only exception where a non out-of-source build tree still works). Judging from your post, I reckon you have not read these documentation pages:\u003cbr\u003e\n[ul][li]\u003ca href=\"http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_building.html%5B/li%5D\"\u003ehttp://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_building.html[/li]\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n[li]\u003ca href=\"http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_using_library.html%5B/li%5D%5B/ul%5D\"\u003ehttp://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_using_library.html[/li][/ul]\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe first page explains how to build Urho3D library properly, while the second one how to use the library in your own project. I shall stress it again that our build scripts make certain assumption on the project structure as per documentation. They expect your own project to be the same as Urho3D project structure. That’s the price we have to pay in order to reuse the existing scripts (which by the way were initially only intended for Urho3D project). To put it in another words, if you don’t want to follow the book and want to have your project however you like and want to be able to invoke CMake however you like then you would have to write your own CMakeLists.txt build scripts for your own project instead of reusing our CMakeLists.txt. Now, that approach is perfectly fine if you ask me (just make sure you have set all the compiler definitions, compiler flags, linker flags, compiler header search path, linker library dependency, etc by yourself correctly).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf, however, you choose to spend a few minutes to read the above documentation pages but still cannot get it to work then you are welcome again to post your problem here. BTW, you may want to know that Urho build scripts and source codes are being tested for all the platforms that it supports almost every day (See \u003ca href=\"https://travis-ci.org/urho3d/Urho3D/builds\"\u003etravis-ci.org/urho3d/Urho3D/builds\u003c/a\u003e). So, it could not be that broken as you have described it in your first post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding the point 1.c. I am not the original author, so you will have to wait to hear from him on this design decision. But, if I may say something about it then I would say there is nothing wrong with it. In fact that is what makes Urho build so fast. Between a convenience of having one huge header that includes all the bits and bytes and an inconvenience of having a set of smaller header files which need to be mixed and matched on demand as required by the code, I would choose the latter any time for the sake of build speed alone. I am an Urho convert so I may be biased  \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\"\u003e . And the SDL header search path should be set accordingly by our build scripts if you have used the build scripts correctly. Like you say, whether to have a “SDL/” prefix path or not is a design decision, as long as the header search path is being configured correctly and all the headers are found then I don’t think there is anything wrong with that. But then again I am not the original author, so be prepared to get the full rebuke from him (I am joking of course).\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:01:04.872Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":7,"reads":36,"readers_count":35,"score":42.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":520,"topic_slug":"urho3d-build-system","display_username":"Yao Wei Tjong","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_building.html%5B/li%5D","internal":false,"reflection":false,"clicks":9},{"url":"https://travis-ci.org/urho3d/Urho3D/builds","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Travis CI - Test and Deploy Your Code with Confidence","clicks":6},{"url":"http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_using_library.html%5B/li%5D%5B/ul%5D","internal":false,"reflection":false,"clicks":6}],"read":true,"user_title":"Admin","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":4,"hidden":false,"trust_level":4,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":2885,"name":"Lasse Öörni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2014-11-03T09:14:29.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eWhen recently using Urho3D as a part of an application, I’ve noticed some problems with include files as well. In my case these had mostly to do with ambiguities, like the application and Urho both defining a file Scene.h, which is a bit nasty and not the general use case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in general, it might be beneficial for Urho internal files to either:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInclude Urho’s own header files through a single root include directory, instead of having each of the sub-directories (Scene, Engine etc.) as required include directories for the project.

Therefore including \u0026lt;SDL_Joystick.h\u0026gt; is proper, as we don’t have a directory named “SDL” in any of the include paths. Rather the directory “ThirdParty/SDL/include” is used as a project-wide include directory. I’m not sure if all third-party libraries could be made to work using a single root include directory. Attempting this would likely require an install step for each of the libraries, so that the headers are installed under a common root.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe some of the CMake setup difficulties could be overcome by having a CMake install step that ensures production of a correctly formed SDK regardless of the CMake output directory.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":3,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:01:05.076Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":30,"readers_count":29,"score":6.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":520,"topic_slug":"urho3d-build-system","display_username":"Lasse Öörni","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"Urho3D Author","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":3,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":2889,"name":"","username":"doodloo","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/d/41988e/{size}.png","created_at":"2014-11-03T10:04:15.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eHello, and thank you for answering me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003caside class=\"quote\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e … Judging from your post, I reckon you have not read these documentation pages … \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understand that my post might have gave this impression.

The best way to try such setup is to try to build with a different user that owns the source. It doesn’t work with Urho3D: files are being created in some initial folders (Bin, Lib, etc). Also, building “by the book” for other targets than the native one produces a non-standard layout (ios-Bin etc) within the source tree.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen running make install after building (And having a per-platform target directory, eg /opt/Urho3d/MacOSXShared for one, /opt/Urho3D/iOSShared for another, etc) gives unexpected results: impossible to have a proper Release build for iOS for instance, because the only way to build for iOS seems to build with XCode, which by default is configured by CMake to use the Debug build for the Run / Archive actions.

But really, most developers wouldn’t really care about a few seconds more of building the SDK. Regarding user-code using the SDK, most compilers are smart, and if you put the correct guards in headers, they are not “really” included. Because of this, it won’t really matter if you’re including .h files from your files to compensate, because whatever if you include them from your .h or from your .cpp, the thing is that you will have to include them anyway. The result is the same. Having written many libraries (Some of them being very big) with this in mind, i have a few recommendations about this (Also addresses the bizare paths for some headers) \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst let’s take the example of the SDL file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003caside class=\"quote\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e… Therefore including \u0026lt;SDL_Joystick.h\u0026gt; is proper, as we don’t have a directory named “SDL” in any of the include paths.

The proper way (As most library do), is to have an SDK (No source code, it is stripped when going “make install”.

This is just a matter of setting up properly the include paths of CMake to the directory containing the “SDL/” folder in the original source code, or create it if necessary. This way, any Urho3D referencing the SDL would work in the “SDK” context as well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom what i have read from the documentation, Urho3D tries to abstract third party libraries.

They make certain assumptions on the project structure (Bin, Lib, Build for native build and their platform-specific variants for the corss-compiling builds). I agree that this restricts the full usefulness of CMake in generating arbitrary out-of-source build tree. At the time I was rewriting the build scripts, it looks like a good idea to let the shell scripts (cmake_gcc.sh and cmake_macosx.sh) determine the build tree location on behalf of the user, based on the environment variable values and shell script parameters. I could, for example, only invoke the cmake_gcc.sh only one time and the shell script would configure and generate one build tree for native (Build) and also the other three build trees for cross-compiling platforms (android-Build, mingw-Build, and raspi-Build) in one go without me repeating myself specifying which build tree for which target platform each time. You would be surprised how many times I had to nuke all my build trees and regenerate them just to verify my changes during that time. There were no Travis CI builds yet then. Thus, it appeared to be a good trade-off at that time (at least to me). Later on we have to move this assumption of the build tree locations further into other logic in our build script (e.g. FindUrho3D.cmake) so that we can support external project referencing to Urho3D library just from its build tree in a cross-platform manner (i.e. without actually forcing user to install the Urho3D library first). Currently all the sample apps and tools in the Urho3D project are configured this way, they depends on Urho3D library from the build tree. Don’t get me wrong here. I am not trying to defend this. If I could go back in time and do it differently then perhaps I would not let the shell scripts to decide the build tree location on user behalf again. So, in my example above I would have to call the shell script four times with some way to pass a different build tree location for each targeted platforms. And perhaps we would have other solution too in order to support external project referencing to Urho3D library in the build tree without making those assumptions, but more like by requiring user to provide the required information one way or another during project configuration of the external project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003caside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"doodloo\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/d/41988e/40.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003e doodloo:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, building “by the book” for other targets than the native one produces a non-standard layout (ios-Bin etc) within the source tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The book” I was referring to is our documentation pages obviously.

Most of us know that the Urho3D’s master branch is as stable as any its releases, so we pull, build, and use the newly built lib straight from the build tree.
