I'm not looking for anything fancy. I just want some AI characters to be able to walk around at this point.

for just walking around you could use the navigation system.
If you can get more specific about what you want to achieve we could give better help.

Just basic AI at this point. The ability to walk around, and navigate on there own.
Maybe even go after the player.
Shooting would be nice as well.

Okay I have viewed those in the past. I'll take a look again.


Thanks
