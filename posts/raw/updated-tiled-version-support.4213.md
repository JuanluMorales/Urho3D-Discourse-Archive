Hello everyone, I wanted to ask if there was any plan to bump the tiled version support. Unless I am mistaken, the current supported version is 0.9.1 . But since then interested features such as animated tiles were added.

I think it would be faster with github PR, as very little people here know that Urho supports Tileed of any particular version.
