Docs are not very good, but the editor is awesome.

Beautiful. I was looking to start working on visual effects for my game soon as well!

Anyone thinking of implementing this/already done so? If not, I'll probably take a stab at it rather than rolling my own in Urho.

Wow, the 1.5 version is amazing! Shouldn't be hard to integrate it into Urho, I already did on my self game engine and was very simple.
