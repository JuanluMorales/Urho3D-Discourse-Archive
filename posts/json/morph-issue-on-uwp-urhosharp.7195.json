I’ve now been asked for a Desktop (Windows) version of the app. I added a UWP project to my solution, and was pleasantly surprised that I was able to render my Urho model in the UWP project. Unfortunately, I discovered that my morphing is not working in the UWP version. I am using \u003ccode\u003eSetMorphWeight()\u003c/code\u003e in my code. The exception that I am getting is:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003eFailed to map vertex buffer (HRESULT 80070057). You can omit this exception by subscribing to Urho.Application.UnhandledException event and set Handled property to True.\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny pointers about what I should do differently on UWP vs iOS and Android?

IIRC, the last time I face down that error, it was caused by me accessing Urho from a non-Urho thread.    In Urho, gotta make sure all calls to Urho (the ones that write to the GPU especially, like VertexBuffer.SetData/Size, etc, MUST be done from the Urho Update thread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we fixed the couple violations where we did something like this from a Non-URHO thread, this issue went away for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e===\u003cbr\u003e\nThe best way I’ve found for diagnosing issues with UrhoSharp is the basic trial/error method, where you just dumb down whatever is failing to something far more basic, and then once it starts working, then reverse the process adding in more things until it starts failing.  In this way, you narrow down the “cause” – which could be just “one settings”, or something else small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know it’s not a magic solution, but hope this might help.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2022-02-25T00:24:33.462Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":18,"readers_count":17,"score":8.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":7195,"topic_slug":"morph-issue-on-uwp-urhosharp","display_username":"Brian Knox","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1334,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":44725,"name":"","username":"csteaderman","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/c/b487fb/{size}.png","created_at":"2022-02-25T23:04:07.939Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThanks for taking time to read and respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is an interesting idea.
