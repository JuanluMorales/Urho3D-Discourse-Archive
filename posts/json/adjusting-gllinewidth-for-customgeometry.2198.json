I’m able to render shapes but I was wondering whether there is a way in Urho3D’s API to modify the glLineWidth of a CustomGeometry instance? My use case is as follows, if it helps: I’m working on a card game which utilizes geometry as a mechanic, so there will be a field of play which is a circle, and many regular polygons inscribed within that circle. Ultimately I’d like to be able to vary the width of the various lines or polygons on the play field. Whether it is easier and better to do this by modifying glLineWidth on a per-geometry basis, or whether I should just use actual models for things like volumetric lines and the circular play-field itself, I am unsure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApologies if this question is unclear, and thanks in advance for your help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoculator\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:13:52.323Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":123,"reads":27,"readers_count":26,"score":620.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":2198,"topic_slug":"adjusting-gllinewidth-for-customgeometry","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":537,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":13336,"name":"Lasse Öörni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2016-08-22T19:55:45.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eWelcome!
