Secondly, set the environment variable to tell the build system where is your Android SDK and/or Android NDK when they are not in their default expected location. Set “ANDROID_HOME” for the former and set the “ANDROID_NDK” for the latter. In general, if you install Android SDK in the system default location and then use the provided “sdk manager” to download the embedded NDK and embedded CMake then there is no env-var that you need to manually set.

Depending on what build options are being enabled, one would get a different customized build result. Having said that, our default build options (when user does not explicitly set them one way or another) are decent one for native/desktop build, but that may not be so good for Android build. The default URHO3D_SAMPLES=1 and URHO3D_LIB_TYPE=STATIC alone would already generate 50+ *.so with Urho3D library statically linked, not to mention the Android Gradle plugin will do that twice (one for Debug build config and one for Release) and will do all of that 4 times over (one for each ABI). In short, tweak the build options to get the custom build result that you desired. Use split ABI and use SHARED lib type instead.
