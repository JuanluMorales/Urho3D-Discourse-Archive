Here’s the situation I have with my game idea:  Essentially; I have several models that don’t “need” to be textured but do need to be either just a solid color or a shaded color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy question is on the way that the renders ( for Linux, Android, Windows, and iOS ) will render my models.  \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-u\"\u003eTextured\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e / \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-u\"\u003eShaded-Color\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e / \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-u\"\u003eSolid-Color\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e ( i don’t know yet if i can do just solid-color somehow )\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich way will render fastest / faster / fast ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emy “theory” is that if I don’t use any materials or textures and just use a solid color for each mesh in the model ( every model will have 2 or more meshes ) then i “think” that the renderes will process them extremely fast compared to using textures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course that “theory” is based on the work that the video cards do for OpenGL and OpenGL ES… However… my theory won’t work out like i think if the various video card hardware is “designed” to render textures ‘faster’ than solid or shaded colors and that’s something I have no clue about at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you could let me know which order of speed that modern video card hardware will render my models at then I would be most extremely grateful for all the MASSIVE time and headaches you will be saving me  \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=5\" title=\":smiley:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":smiley:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:02:51.301Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":2,"reads":5,"readers_count":4,"score":13.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":782,"topic_slug":"advanced-rendering-question-about-textured-vs-solid-models","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":188,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":4273,"name":"Lasse Öörni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2015-01-21T15:41:43.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eYou could assume that the rendering which results in the least complex pixel shader will render fastest, given that other variables (like the vertex shader, amount of vertices, amount of screen space filled) stays constant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe order from least to most complex would be:\u003cbr\u003e\nuntextured unlit\u003cbr\u003e\ntextured unlit\u003cbr\u003e\nuntextured lit\u003cbr\u003e\ntextured lit\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLighting stresses the arithmetic unit(s) while texture fetches stress memory bandwidth; either can become the bottleneck, or then the bottleneck may also be elsewhere such as vertex processing or framebuffer fillrate, in which case the pixel shader performance actually doesn’t matter.
