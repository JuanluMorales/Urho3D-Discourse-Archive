[github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/graphs/punch-card](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/graphs/punch-card). We have a little activity in a particular time zone. It is either we don't have Urho3D users from that particular time zone OR the users from that time zone have not contributed back enough (no contributors). And I think it is the latter :slight_smile:.

If all of us get the same graph result then it can only mean one thing. It is not reported in one's "local time".

Yep from the mouth of the github overlords: "Note that the traffic graphs uses the UTC+0 timezone, regardless of your location."
