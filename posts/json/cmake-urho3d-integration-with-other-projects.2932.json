However, SDL is also one of those projects. If I link both Urho3D and SDL I get linker errors since another version of SDL is already linked with Urho3D…which is totally expected. I cannot just drop SDL from my project, I need it for audio, threading and synchronization, plus I always keep it up to date with SDL2.
