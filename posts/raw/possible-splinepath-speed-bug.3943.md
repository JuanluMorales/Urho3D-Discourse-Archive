It looks like speed changes between control point path segment. See gif below.
I set the speed of each node to be the same. But it changes between control points.
On short segment node move slower.

What you mean?
If I have a linear line to travel. With a constant speed ( same for each characters), Shouldn't I get a constant gap between the characters.

I'm not sure if the interpolate position GetPoint return the correct position. The following calculation is done similar to a single node Move method.

I do think this is intended behaviour for a spline path.

-------------------------

George1 | 2018-01-14 09:26:54 UTC | #6

This is the calculation.

float newDistance = lstPed_[i]->relativePosInQueue_ + dt * lstPed_[i]->speed_;
float traveled_ = newDistance / queuePath_->GetLength();
lstPed_[i]->GetNode()->SetWorldPosition(queuePath_->GetPoint(traveled_));

-------------------------

If you divide the speed by the length of the current segment it should be constant.

-------------------------

George1 | 2018-01-14 09:29:51 UTC | #8

I don't believe this is correct.

If it is a linear. It is easy to get the correct position.

The behaviour is wrong. Theoretically.

For _your_ use case, yes.
The interpolation logic _is_ consistent along different interpolation modes.

-------------------------

George1 | 2018-01-14 09:33:35 UTC | #10

The current logic return incorrect position as you can see in the gif.

-------------------------

Modanung | 2018-01-14 09:35:03 UTC | #11

What if you were to move the knots during runtime? Which behaviour would you expect?

-------------------------

George1 | 2018-01-14 09:37:36 UTC | #12

I recalculate the length using the built in SplinePath function when I move the knots.

-------------------------

George1 | 2018-01-14 09:39:45 UTC | #13

Anyway maybe leave it here.
I'm only trying to report a possible bug/behaviour.

I will fix the interpolation.

The math should be easy.

Best regards

This supports my not-a-bug theory. ;)

Thanks I have done this a number of years ago in Irrlicht.

Are you talking about linear interpolation between control points or more complex cases too?

-------------------------

George1 | 2018-01-14 14:16:59 UTC | #17

Yes! Navigate through multi control points.

For linear polyline.
It is easier to fix the behaviour. E.g.
I speed up my simulation clock to reduce the file size of the gif.

![Linear Spline fixed|628x500](upload://eOXLhO7Jw2PG4J6YP0GYCQ73zy2.gif)

For catmul-rom I can use this multi linear line segment method or the calculus method via simson's rule.

-------------------------

A simple piecewise linear over existing interpolation.

![Linear Spline fixed|427x327](upload://8c34p9g67H0EmapvmRU4rKaR3nk.gif)

I first linearized the spline. 

void LinearisedPath()
{

		if (queuePath_->GetControlPoints().Size() > 2)
		{
			Spline spline = queuePath_->GetSpline();
			int size = queuePath_->GetControlPoints().Size();
			double rate = 0.001f;
			splinePath_.Clear();
			for (float f = 0.f; f <= 1.0f; f += rate)
			{
				Vector3 b = spline.GetPoint(f).GetVector3();
				splinePath_.AddKnot(b);
			}
		}
		else if (queuePath_->GetControlPoints().Size() == 2)
		{
			splinePath_ = queuePath_->GetSpline();
		}

}


Then loop through like below.

        Vector<Variant> knots_ = splinePath_.GetKnots();
	int size = knots_.Size();
	int segment = 1;
	float sumLength = 0.0f;

	for (; segment < size; segment++)
	{

		float segmentLength = (knots_[segment].GetVector3() - knots_[segment - 1].GetVector3()).Length();
		sumLength += segmentLength;
		if (sumLength >= relativeDistance)
			break;
	}

	if (segment == size)
	{
		segment--;
	}

	Vector3 dir = knots_[segment].GetVector3() - knots_[segment - 1].GetVector3();
	dir.y_ = 0;
	dir.Normalize();
	Vector3 pos = knots_[segment].GetVector3() - dir * (sumLength - character->relativePosInQueue_);
	Quaternion Q;
	Q.FromLookRotation(dir);
	Q.Normalize();
	character->GetNode()->SetRotation(Quaternion());
	character->GetNode()->SetWorldRotation(Q);
	character->GetNode()->SetWorldPosition(pos);


I recommend we have dynamic number of interpolate segment increases with number of control points. This will remove the debug line drawn bug.
