Well guess what?   The MIN value for NearClip is 0.01.   I never thought to check that this value was actually being set to my fully legitimate value of 0.00001, and so spent hours trying to figure out what I was messing up in my shaders or code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn our Map application scene, since we show a World Map, it was very nice to have “1 Unit = 1 Degree” (which is about 60 miles!).    So our scene was just dealing mostly with small values, but the Unit size was meaningful for this context.    The world map was exactly 360 units (i.e. “degrees” wide).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of our app already \u003cem\u003ethinks\u003c/em\u003e in terms of “Degrees”, so this really just made sense for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, though, 0.01 unit for us equates to about 3600 feet!   When in Ground Mode, that’s where the 0.01 near plan clipping was horrid… clipping everything closer than 3600 feet.   Ouch.  That’s awful for a cockpit view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish Urho hadn’t implemented this unnecessary/arbitrary Minimum NearClip value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result, we’re forced to use a 100,000 conversion factor, so that 100,000 units is now 1 degree.  And to convert between Urho WorldSpace and the rest of our app, we now need to employ this conversion factor.   All because Urho decided to artificially limit our NearClip to 0.01 minimum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust airing a complaint.  And also hoping that maybe this post will help prevent others from running into this same issue.   And maybe this post might inspire Urho team to remove this Minimum (probably not, but worth a shot).\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2021-03-12T02:37:30.546Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":4,"reads":29,"readers_count":28,"score":25.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":6754,"topic_slug":"minimum-nearclip-is-0-01-arghh","display_username":"Brian Knox","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1334,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":42110,"name":"J Tippetts","username":"JTippetts1","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/jtippetts1/{size}/96_2.png","created_at":"2021-03-12T04:41:09.946Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThe smaller you make nearClip_ the more problems you are likely to encounter regarding depth buffer precision.

Our goal is to use only the released version of UrhoSharp / RbfxSharp.    More of us will be coming (Xamarin/.NET devs using Urho).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf they were to change the main branch code, IMO, they should change “nearClip = max(value, 0.01)” to something like “if (value == 0) value = 0.01;” as the safeguard… or throw an exception.   Then allow users to set their own ranges without limit (except for “0” which is never allowed).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor games/apps that think in “Globe space” (e.g. “earth”), it’s very easy to think of all positions as “degrees”.  And so your world’s min/max 3D position values are all in the range of -180 to +180… and close up, 0.02 is approximately 1 mile distance, and 0.000005 is about about 1 foot, and is a reasonable NearClip distance for ground-view for apps/games that work inside this Globe scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the 0.01 min NearClip, we’ve altered our scale to 1 Degree = 100,000 units.
