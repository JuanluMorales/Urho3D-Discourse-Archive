There are some AngelScript IDEs out there, naturally there are a lot of things that support Lua, and C++ has Visual Studio, Eclipse CDT, Codeblocks, etc. But there isn’t really anything specific to Urho besides the Editor, which is mostly just for scene construction. The Editor is, I suppose, kind of like CopperCube, but programming is a heavy focus of Urho (e.g. I almost never use the editor except to view the scene heirarchy of a saved scene from my game), while CopperCube from the brief look I gave it seems to hide that from the user.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAssuming I know what you mean, yes.
