For example, 800-1200 RPM, 1200-2000, and so on. Depending on the RPM of the engine, you play the sound for that range (or a list of sounds so it doesn‚Äôt sound monotonic and use some random function) and change the sound pitch. Sound for 800-1200 would be 1000 RPM, if you are running at 800, you pitch down the sound 10% of its speed.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSame as above, attach the sound to the moving car.

High RPM means more pulling power and cleaner burn, low RPM is more efficient fuel-wise.\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen releasing the clutch with too low an RPM - and too much resistance on the driven wheels - the engine stops running.
