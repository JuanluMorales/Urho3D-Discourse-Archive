> It will soon head off to *Ghotiland*,
a place to make our *final* stand
There [*Ozom*](https://jenerd.nl/images/OzomNightausent.png) rules and [Pepe](https://margotwatkins.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/flat-frog1.jpg)'s dead,
the fish revered, *free* from dread
Lose your body, but *keep* a head
*Into* the unknown, when not misled

```
 Urho may be split in two, but his spirit swims on within you
 May he ward off all toxicity and let us ever flow creatively
 We can still collaborate, need not frown or mourn; celebrate
 For tragic loss opens a gate, thereby revealing a lucky fate
