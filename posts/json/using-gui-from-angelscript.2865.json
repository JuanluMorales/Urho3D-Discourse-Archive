For some strange reason, regardless of window\u003cbr\u003e\nsize I see resolution reported to be 1024x768, so menu is offset and not really adequate. There‚Äôs no such\u003cbr\u003e\nproblem with full screen, but I need windowed mode to be working right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn many cases I want widgets to be automatically placed on screen. I know how to do it by hand,\u003cbr\u003e\nbut is it possible to set some default for some container so everything there is autoplaced?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Adding items to container dynamically, containers often break and display items one over another.\u003cbr\u003e\nIt doesn‚Äôt happen when I just set up them once via xml.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can‚Äôt make drop-down list work. Whatever I try I can‚Äôt see any items inside. I know it works in editor,\u003cbr\u003e\nbut when I copy-paste it breaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try this all with AngelScript.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso I have additional question - is it possible to create custom widget using AnglScript? Most\u003cbr\u003e\nimportant widget I need it a button, and i can represent everything with buttons and windows,\u003cbr\u003e\nexcept for input boxes (which work too, so no problem here) but I‚Äôd like to have some changes on layout and\u003cbr\u003e\nstyle (I don‚Äôt need this GUI-system look, just clickable pic is fine), but I need widget-relative coordinates\u003cbr\u003e\nfrom mouse clicks, is it possible to implement with AngelScript-only?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks!\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-03-08T08:41:41.121Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":37,"reads":23,"readers_count":22,"score":189.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":2865,"topic_slug":"using-gui-from-angelscript","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":554,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false}],"stream":[16458]},"timeline_lookup":[[1,2086]],"suggested_topics":[{"id":7358,"title":"Linux
