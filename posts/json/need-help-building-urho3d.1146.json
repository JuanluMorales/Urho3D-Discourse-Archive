I donwloaded the source right off the main page. Then I downloaded cmake. I ran the CMake GIU and put “Urho3D-1.4/Source” for the source directory, and “Urho3D-1.4/Build” as the build directory (after making the Build folder). Then I go to configure, and set “MinGW Makefiles” as the project Generator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything seems to go fine, it gets to “looking for include file stdint.h - found”. Then It gives this error: \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003eCMake Error at ThirdParty/FreeType/CMakeLists.txt:80 (setup_library):\u003cbr\u003e\nUnknown CMake command “setup_library”.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the window above, everything looks fine, except that the CMAKE_SH field says “CMAKE_SH-NOTFOUND”. I replaced it with the directory for make, and I still get the error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know what else I can do.

In release 1.4, when using CMake GUI you should put “Urho3D-1.4” or what have you as the source directory but you can specify anywhere you like for the build directory. Preferably, put the build directory outside of the “Urho3D-1.4”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the release prior to 1.4, we used to have the main CMakeLists.txt located in the “Source” subdirectory. Now in 1.4 the main CMakeLists.txt is located in the root of the project. In the release prior to 1.4 user was not able to specify the build tree path freely as it is now in 1.4. So, if you are reading an old online guide from sources outside of our project, please tell the author of the guide to update it.
