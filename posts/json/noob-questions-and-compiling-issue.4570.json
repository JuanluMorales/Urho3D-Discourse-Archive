I am new here.  I wanted to introduce myself, ask some basic questions, and get help with an issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am “primem0ver”.  My real name is Matthew.  I am working on a large prototyping project that makes use of 3d modeling.  The project currently uses the Irrlicht engine (\u003ca href=\"http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttp://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/\u003c/a\u003e) which in coding terms, is \u003cem\u003ealmost\u003c/em\u003e perfect for my purposes.  However, I want to expand the interface to allow use of OpenGL ES on tablets which is not currently supported by Irrlicht.  This was one of the first engines I found when doing a search on Google.  I wanted to make sure it will suit my needs so I have listed some requirements below.  I am also having a problem getting the project downloaded from your sight to compile so I describe that below as well.  Any insight and help would be greatly appreciated.
