I create my scene programatically (Character is instantiated, Character::Start is called), dump it to xml, and then reload it. This destroys the existing Scene, but when the scene is re-loaded, and the Character object reconstructed, and Character::Start again called, the event subscription is being ignored. Yet a short while later, Character::Update is able to subscribe with success! Something is very strange, and it’s very likely related to my teardown and recreation of the scene at runtime. Still, the call to subscribe is definitely being made after loading, and being silently ignored for no apparent reason. I can certainly write a workaround that lets me subscribe to the event on demand during update, but the code would “smell bad”. Wonder what I’m doing, or not doing, that is causing this issue?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[EDIT] Well, now I have discovered that SOME event subscriptions in the Character::Start method work fine - so far its only the Trigger event that is failing to register correctly.

The reason is that my AnimatedModel is not connected to the same (root) node as my Character component, there is a child node that applies scale \u003cem\u003ebelow\u003c/em\u003e the character/physics/controller - an adjustment node is the true parent of my animated model, and I need it to exist before I can register my event handler. I used “DelayedStart”, which is called only when all the components and nodes have been constructed.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe reason I needed a scaling node is because I started out playing with ragdolls, and noticed that physics objects are subject to node scaling - I did not wish scale to be applied to my physics objects, but I still wanted to scale my model down 100 times (wouldn’t it be cool if the AssetExporter could apply a fixed scale to vertices and animation translations during export?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to prevent foot-slipping on animated models using dynamic physics, I implemented a cheap form of “foot-planting”, which I briefly described here: \u003ca href=\"https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/wip-screenshot-everyone-loves-zombies/4892/10?u=leith\" class=\"inline-onebox\"\u003eWIP Screenshot - Everyone loves zombies!\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have more specific questions, or would like to see sourcecode, I’d be happy to talk about my solution (which still needs work, as it is causing the character to walk through solid objects, but I’ll keep tinkering until I get it perfect… I’m effectively ignoring the state of the physics hull while walking, which is not exactly ideal…)\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":8,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2019-02-12T02:35:03.855Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":7,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":22,"readers_count":21,"score":4.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":4902,"topic_slug":"regarding-animationtriggers-solved","display_username":"Leith Ketchell","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":3,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/wip-screenshot-everyone-loves-zombies/4892/10","internal":true,"reflection":false,"title":"Dishonourable Discharge - A Zombie Horror Survival Adventure","clicks":1}],"read":true,"user_title":"suspended user","title_is_group":false,"reply_to_user":{"username":"GodMan","name":"","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/g/e79b87/{size}.png"},"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1098,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"user_suspended":true,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":28115,"name":"","username":"GodMan","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/g/e79b87/{size}.png","created_at":"2019-02-12T03:55:14.532Z","cooked":"\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e#include \u0026lt;Urho3D/Core/Context.h\u0026gt;\n#include \u0026lt;Urho3D/Graphics/AnimationController.h\u0026gt;\n#include \u0026lt;Urho3D/IO/MemoryBuffer.h\u0026gt;\n#include \u0026lt;Urho3D/Physics/PhysicsEvents.h\u0026gt;\n#include \u0026lt;Urho3D/Physics/PhysicsWorld.h\u0026gt;\n#include \u0026lt;Urho3D/Physics/RigidBody.h\u0026gt;\n#include \u0026lt;Urho3D/Scene/Scene.h\u0026gt;\n#include \u0026lt;Urho3D/Scene/SceneEvents.h\u0026gt;\n#include \u0026lt;Urho3D/Input/Input.h\u0026gt;\n#include \u0026lt;Urho3D/Graphics/DrawableEvents.h\u0026gt;\n#include \u0026lt;Urho3D/Graphics/AnimatedModel.h\u0026gt;\n#include \u0026lt;Urho3D/Audio/SoundSource3D.h\u0026gt;\n#include \u0026lt;Urho3D/Audio/Sound.h\u0026gt;\n#include \u0026lt;Urho3D/Audio/AudioEvents.h\u0026gt;\n#include \u0026lt;Urho3D/Resource/ResourceCache.h\u0026gt;\n#include \u0026lt;Urho3D/Graphics/ParticleEffect.h\u0026gt;\n#include \u0026lt;Urho3D/Graphics/ParticleEmitter.h\u0026gt;\n\n#include \"Character.h\"\n#include \"GameObject.h\"\n\n\n\nCharacter::Character(Context* context) :\n    LogicComponent(context),\n    onGround_(false),\n    okToJump_(true),\n    inAirTimer_(0.0f)\n{\n    // Only the physics update event is needed: un-subscribe from the rest for optimization\n    SetUpdateEventMask(USE_FIXEDUPDATE);\n}\n\nvoid Character::RegisterObject(Context* context)\n{\n\n    context-\u0026gt;RegisterFactory\u0026lt;Character\u0026gt;();\n\n    // These macros register the class attributes to the Context for automatic load / save handling.\n    // We specify the Default attribute mode which means it will be used both for saving into file, and network replication\n    URHO3D_ATTRIBUTE(\"Controls Yaw\", float, controls_.yaw_, 0.0f, AM_DEFAULT);\n    URHO3D_ATTRIBUTE(\"Controls Pitch\", float, controls_.pitch_, 0.0f, AM_DEFAULT);\n    URHO3D_ATTRIBUTE(\"On Ground\", bool, onGround_, false, AM_DEFAULT);\n    URHO3D_ATTRIBUTE(\"OK To Jump\", bool, okToJump_, true, AM_DEFAULT);\n    URHO3D_ATTRIBUTE(\"In Air Timer\", float, inAirTimer_, 0.0f, AM_DEFAULT);\n}\n\nvoid Character::Start()\n{\n    // Component has been inserted into its scene node.
