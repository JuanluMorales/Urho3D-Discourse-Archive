When the \u003ccode\u003eURHO3D_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET\u003c/code\u003e build option is not explicitly set then it is default to value ‘native’. This is good for testing the binary in your own host system because the compiler will generate the binary targeting exactly your system.

It may not generate binary as “generic” as it should be, depending on what is being defaulted by the compiler. Perhaps this can be considered as a bug in our build system then.
