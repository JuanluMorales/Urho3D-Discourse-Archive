When I search "android" on the forum, it returns:
[i]The following words in your search query were ignored because they are too common words: [b]android[/b][/i].

Yet, words like "save" and "file" are not common and returns a long list of matches.  Even doing advance search, such as "android+tutorial" comes up with:
[i]The following words in your search query were ignored because they are too common words: [b]android android+tutorial[/b].[/i]

I don't understand how the search works on the forum.

Is there some admin settings to set specific word settings, such as setting the word "android" as non common?

I suggest you search with google instead just add "site:urho3d.prophpbb.com" to the google search bar and you are good to go. :wink:

(I am a googlebot so of course I would know. :smiley:  :laughing: )

That'll work, thanks.
