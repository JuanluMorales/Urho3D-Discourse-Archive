I’m using, for the most part, the same Java files that come as samples, only changing the package name. Soon I’d like to ditch the useless intent entierly, as there is only the one library. The APK compiles fine, and I’m able to use “ant installd” to move it to my phone for testing. However, upon running it, the app “opens” for a split second and then crashes back to the home screen. It’s not an actual exception crash, but the engine stops itself. Examining the logcat shows this line:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can plainly see the Data folder within the APK if I open it as an archive, it’s in the assets/ directory, as it is within the projects plain file system.
