Instead Y is now “Altitude”. (i.e. UP)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo our code is riddled with conversion from Vector2.XY to Vector3.XZ… and are constantly assigning Y to Z and Z to Y as we convert back and forth between the conventions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo begs the question – should we just make the 3D renderer \u003cem\u003ealso\u003c/em\u003e use Y as North-South, and let Z be UP???\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I think this is likely a bad idea, because then it alters the meaning of “Yaw/Pitch/Roll” – as I think “Yaw” in most 3D game engines is tied to rotating about the Y-Axis. So if we changed Z to up… then we’d have to change over to using “Roll” instead of “Yaw” to control the “bearing” of an entity (NSEW horizontal direction/angle). And “Roll” would be weird for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there is the issue of most objects – Roll tends to mean “rotation along the Frontal axis” (like for an aircraft).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so my tentative conclusion is that “It’s best to keep Y as UP”, as the confusion of XY = XZ for positional placement is easier than changing the conventional meaning of Yaw vs Roll.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2022-02-14T05:17:28.141Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":4,"reads":26,"readers_count":25,"score":25.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":7193,"topic_slug":"can-z-axis-feasibly-be-up","display_username":"Brian Knox","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1334,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":44664,"name":"Brian Knox","username":"najak3d","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/n/6a8cbe/{size}.png","created_at":"2022-02-14T05:17:47.737Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eOne solution that we have employed to reduce the current XY to XZ pain is to create a new struct called something like LocXZ which is equivalent to Vector2, but uses “Z” instead of “Y”, and then have implicit conversion defined to/from Vector2. But nearly all of our code uses the LocXZ.
