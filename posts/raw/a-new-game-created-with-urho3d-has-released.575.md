Hi, I have release a new android 2d game Perfect Blocks,

I played it and enjoyed it -- very nice, professional aesthetic. The ads were full on, like one would expect from a free mobile game I guess, but I think it's also a bit unfortunate that on my test device the bottom bar ad causes frame drops which affects game play.

The google play integration is pretty cool, although I noticed someone already cheated the rankings.

I'm glad you like my game  :smiley: ?
I also noticed the rankings cheating problem, I will fix it next version, and also remove the banner ads.
