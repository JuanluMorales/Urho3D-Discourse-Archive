Earlier I trying compile Editor.as into Editor.asc and find that it become loads much more faster then using usual Editor.as

If anyone wanted to modify the editor in any way, they would need to re-compile the scripts again. Unfortunately that's not an automated process, and not something that we could expect every beginning user to understand. So it's going to be generally better to leave it as-is and let people compile it if they want.
