Sometimes it might actually run higher fps even if the drawing area is bigger. I have a feeling like this is some kind of driver issue, since my pulseaudio keeps crashing from time to time. (I am using asus xonar dx/xd sound card.) I am using engineParameters_[‚ÄúWindowResizable‚Äù] = true, but even if its false and using fullscreen it still does this weird choppiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to admit that I haven‚Äôt been fiddling with linux before, in other words I do not know much about linux, so the settings I have are mostly default.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am using skeletalanimation as my base and I tried to remove update-function from it, so it should be pretty bare bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf my program leaks memory, could it cause something like this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA side note, in windows I didn‚Äôt notice this thing happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: Ok it looks to be some very weird issue with my hardware. For example flash in windows somehow kills my gpu, (ati radeon 5870). I had forgotten to take off hardware acceleration from flash, and that causes some issues. Also cinnamon seems to sometimes semi-crash + pulseaudio, so once I restarted them all + disabled hardware acceleration from flash, it seems to work normally again for now.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:04:06.765Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":3,"reads":1,"readers_count":0,"score":15.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":923,"topic_slug":"some-weird-fps-drop-on-linux-mint-sometimes","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":205,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false}],"stream":[5305]},"timeline_lookup":[[1,2812]],"suggested_topics":[{"id":7081,"title":"Install
