How can I enable some AA algorithm compatible with the deferred renderer?

urho ships with 2 fxaa variants.  it is used as a post processing shader.  you can use the multiple viewport example as a reference on setting up a post processes shader.

Multiple viewport example? I was looking for some specific post-processing sample :slight_smile: thats why I didnt found it. Is FXAA3 better than FXAA2?
