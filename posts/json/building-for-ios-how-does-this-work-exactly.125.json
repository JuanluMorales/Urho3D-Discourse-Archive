I’ve been having a lot of trouble figuring out how to get Urho3D working such that I can take a project built in it and compile it for use in the iOS Simulator program on my OSX machine, however; can someone clarify how I need to set that up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently I have an iOS-targeted Urho3D.xcodeproj file that, when opened, allows me to build the individual demos (“01_HelloWorld”, etc) and run them directly in the Simulator once built.  And, with the help of a friend (and a lot of confusion), we were able to install the OSX native libraries in /usr/local/share/Urho3D/CMake/Modules, and build/run our test project natively in OSX, so I have that much working via the commandline (cmake -\u0026gt; make -\u0026gt; run binary).  Trying to use the “install” build target for the iOS XCode project seemed only to result in .app compiled binaries at that same location, so that didn’t seem to be what was needed…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Incidentally, is there a reason why Urho3D-CMake-magic was not installed as part of the “install” build target for the OSX version of the Urho3D XCode project?  We had to copy it in manually before anything would build…)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem now, though, is that we’re still thoroughly confused as to how we can compile our own stand-alone Urho3D project file for iPhone.  I’m under the impression that we’re supposed to somehow generate a new XCode project by referencing the iOS version of the Urho3D.xcodeproj file as a library?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong story short, can someone with more insight or experience explain just how this iOS build pipeline is supposed to work?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eP.S. - I should add that I’m pretty new to OSX and Apple products in general, but that said, I have a decent amount of experience working with both Linux and Windows systems in the past.  I know my way around a terminal well enough.  If there is a way to do more of the build process for iOS via terminal commands, I’d be interested to know how that is done.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T00:58:14.464Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":331,"reads":19,"readers_count":18,"score":1658.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":125,"topic_slug":"building-for-ios-how-does-this-work-exactly","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":56,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":661,"name":"","username":"skymaker","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/b782af/{size}.png","created_at":"2014-03-10T05:39:55.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eHey again,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorry to bump my post, but after looking over my bleary 2am first post, I thought I’d do better to clean up my questions a bit. /:I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically, I want to understand how an iOS build is done using Urho3D:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom what I can gather from the documentation, and from experimenting myself, I basically need to use the Urho3D.xcodeproj file that is generated using the “cmake_ios.sh” build script.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve run that script, and I can load the resulting project in XCode, and can build/run the demo projects fine from there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, referencing this part of the documentation:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e[quote]iOS build process\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRun cmake_ios.sh.

Admittedly, our current build process is more Urho3D centric, although we now support building Urho3D engine as external library which can be linked by standalone project outside of Urho3D project. I haven’t tried to reference the Urho3D.xcodeproj directly inside a new Xcode project. Let us know your setup if you could make it work that way. Currently though, we have two ways to use Urho3D library as documented in above link.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the latest v1.31 release, we have already renamed our CMake module from Urho3D-CMake-magic to Urho3D-CMake-common. So, if you choose to the second way which install the Urho3D SDK into your filesystem then that module should be installed in this location: /usr/local/share/Urho3D/CMake/Modules/. I have just verified that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short, if you follow our current “limited” documented approach then you first create a new CMake project (that references Urho3D lib as external library). Use CMake to configure and generate your new Xcode project. Open that Xcode project and build. CMake should have configured everything for you already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, if all you intend to do is, to use the AngelScript or Lua to create your application script and let it played using the Urho3DPlayer, then you don’t need to create a new project just for that. You could create the new scripts and simply replace the content of CommandLine.txt to point to your new script.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":3,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T00:58:15.831Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":5,"reads":18,"readers_count":17,"score":28.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":125,"topic_slug":"building-for-ios-how-does-this-work-exactly","display_username":"Yao Wei Tjong","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/a00004.html","internal":false,"reflection":false,"clicks":33}],"read":true,"user_title":"Admin","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":4,"hidden":false,"trust_level":4,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":683,"name":"","username":"skymaker","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/b782af/{size}.png","created_at":"2014-03-11T06:22:13.000Z","cooked":"\u003caside class=\"quote\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/weitjong/40/4_1.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003e weitjong:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…Use CMake to configure and generate your new Xcode project.

Since reading through your post, and revisiting the problem, I believe I now have Urho3D updated and installed on my system as it should be for use as a linked library (I see “Urho3D-CMake-common” in “/usr/local/share/Urho3D/CMake/Modules” as you mention).  So far so good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, when I run “cmake CMakeList.txt …/Source”, and then use “make” on the resulting build files, the result is an OSX binary that I can run locally.  How do I tell CMake to build an iOS XCode project instead?  I’ve looked through the documentation you’ve linked, but I seem to be missing how that is done…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEDIT: Nevermind.  I finally figured out that CMake has a “-G xcode” flag. [/facepalm]   I seem to have this working now; thanks again for your help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEDIT2: Well, seems I’ve traded one problem for another.  When I run the amended command, I get an XCode project, which is good; but it’s set to use the OSX architecture, which is not.  Then, when I go to change the architecture to ARM/iPhone, I get the following build error:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003edependency issue: \ntarget specifies product type 'com.apple.product-type.tool', but there's no such product type for the 'iphonesimulator' platform\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve looked around and tried to figure out how to resolve this - I believe I’m somehow referencing a library that I shouldn’t be for the iPhone platform, presumably one that is automatically assigned when the XCode project is first built with the OSX default architecture - but I’m drawing a blank on how to fix it.
