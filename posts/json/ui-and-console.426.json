Those that you have listed (with the exception of Basic.glsl shader) are just relevant to the UI “skin”. Although it is not being stated as one of the feature but Urho3D UI subsystem is fully skinnable. The “DefaultStyle.xml” is but just one of the default skin or style. There is in fact another old skin “OldStyle.xml” in the UI subdirectory. You can create your own skin that matches your game’s theme, use your own font, use your own UI.png texture file, etc. So, those that you have listed would probably be customized for your own project anyway. You should, however, always create a file similar to UI.xml in the same location of where you put UI.png resource file. For more detail see: \u003ca href=\"http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_materials.html#Materials_Textures\"\u003eurho3d.github.io/documentation/H … s_Textures\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently our rudimentary UI layout editor can only load and edit the UI layout file. It does not load and edit the UI skin/style file as already pointed out. However, it does support applying the UI styles. By default the Editor will load the “DefaultStyle.xml” skin, but if you do have your own style file then you can set the Editor to use it by choosing Editor’s UI-layout | Set default style… menu item. In the Editor’s attribute inspector window, you can inspect what is the current style an UI-element has and change it too. The styles available in the drop down list is data driven based on the number of actual styles available in your skin/style file. Like it or not, the current default style is more geared toward the need of Editor itself. The point is, your game doesn’t even have to use the default. You don’t even have to limit yourself to have only one UI style file in your game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003eAbout the console\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIMHO, the console tries to mimics terminal console which has the standard input, standard output, and standard error streams. I think you have already figured out the output/error part, it just displays them without caring from where those output/error come from. Similarly for the input part, the console is just responsible to accept an input “command string”, it does not itself know what to do with the command string so it just simply dispatches the command string to any classes that subscribed to the console command event. So far we have three subsystem classes that are able to handle this event: filesystem, (Angel)Script, and LuaScript. The filesystem redirects the command string to SystemCommand() call (in Linux platform, this will most likely end up in bash shell trying to interpret it). The Script and LuaScript, on the other hand, will try to “execute” the command string. What important to note here is that the command execution is done using the same AngelScript context and Lua context, respectively, that your application is currently using. In other words, you can use it as your original intuition like modifying the variable values on the fly, changing the game state, or what have you, without even have to writing any callback. If you don’t use any scripting, however, then you will probably have to create a new class that handles the E_CONSOLECOMMAND event and makes it interpret the command string anyway you like it.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":3,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:00:20.555Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":48,"readers_count":47,"score":9.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":426,"topic_slug":"ui-and-console","display_username":"Yao Wei Tjong","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_materials.html#Materials_Textures","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Urho3D - Documentation - Materials","clicks":4}],"read":true,"user_title":"Admin","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":4,"hidden":false,"trust_level":4,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":2330,"name":"","username":"zakk","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/zakk/{size}/871_2.png","created_at":"2014-09-13T18:42:01.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eHello,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, thanks for your replies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must clarify something: as i’m not an english native speaker, some of my posts could be misinterpreted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not criticizing Urho3D when i’m doing a list of what is needed for seeing on screen an UI.

About the documentation, I could not agree more with you that it is rather sparse and hard to understand in some of the sections. Having said that, it actually amazes me that Lasse (the main author of Urho3D) has the time to single-handedly author almost all of those documentation pages. Furthermore, his code is not just clean but also well commented throughout. It is easy to forget that the source code itself is the best documentation to understand Urho3D. Good luck with that with other game engines, especially those closed ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout the event handling, you may want to read this section \u003ca href=\"http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_event_list.html\"\u003eurho3d.github.io/documentation/H … _list.html\u003c/a\u003e to know what event data are available for each event type before attempting to access them in the VariantMap. Again, I agree the documentation is rather sparse on this area. Using your example, it is hard to understand what is the purpose of id string and command string of the console command event without actually peeking at the C++ code. The purpose of the id string is to prevent the command string from being interpreted multiple times by classes that handle console command event. The Console’s UI has a drop down list (when it detects there are more than one handler available the app) to let user choose which class is supposed to interpret the command and pass the chosen class id as one of the event data. So, I hope it is clearer to you now why the event handler has to first check the id to see whether the command string is meant for its consumption before actually attempting to consume
