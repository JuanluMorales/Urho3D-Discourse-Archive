Hello,

I'm looking into technologies that create games that compile to wasm. I'm currently doing a survey of these and came across Urho3D. 

I would really appreciate answers to these questions that other options seem to struggle with:

* What are the typical wasm build sizes of a small project?
* are there any issues with compiled Urho3D projects and IOS safari (regarding wasm)?

Thank you!
