The below lib allows us to do this. I'm not sure about the performance.

Already got that. If I'm not mistaken, last time I've checked it I noticed that Urho already does it all... Honestly I don't know how much Urho "blends" animation for the worst or the better, but apart this leading feature...
Looks a good framework anyway... maybe limited support for only collada and fbx could hamper adoption...
