Thanks for sharing. Do you know a tool to generate SH coefficients from HDR image?

At the time I wrote it, I saw several code that generated SH coefficients but didn't seen any tool for it. I'm not a graphics guy but wrote this as a learning exercise to learn a bit about SHL was how they work. There might be a tool now but I haven't kept up with what's new.
