Physically it should behave as a single rigid body (maybe based on the Raycast Vehicle). However when colliding, I would like to know exactly which of it’s parts was involved in the collision, so that I may change the mesh of that part to one that shows some damage and also I like to keep track of the damaged parts so that later on, when the player enters a garage they are given the option the replace/repair the damaged parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, I would have a node that has a single rigid body and multiple collision shapes, but I couldn’t figure out how to determine which of the collision shapes was involved in the collision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny ideas?
