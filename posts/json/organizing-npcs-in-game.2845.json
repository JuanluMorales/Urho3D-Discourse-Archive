I don‚Äôt have\u003cbr\u003e\nmuch experience with such game structures so I‚Äôd like to get some insight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn GDC videos they say about some characters not having something like Entity and some don‚Äôt,\u003cbr\u003e\nso I wonder, is this related‚Ä¶\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe particular presentation I speak about is \u003ca href=\"http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022411/Massive-Crowd-on-Assassin-s\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttp://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022411/Massive-Crowd-on-Assassin-s\u003c/a\u003e there is also video on Youtube, but it is much less detailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout my problems:\u003cbr\u003e\nI have somewhat working NPCs, but the level of scripts skyrocketed to  unmaintainable,\u003cbr\u003e\nand for last 2 months I try to grasp manageable paradigm, but I seem to miss a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn each character I have the following things:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVisuals\u003c/strong\u003e - looks, so the code which copes with actual graphics (models, etc.).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eControls\u003c/strong\u003e - the low-level part of how character moves and some character animation tweaks\u003cbr\u003e\n(like walk step sync with motion speed). Also some state machinery stuff which is close to controls.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAI\u003c/strong\u003e - the behavior logic with state machinery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis looks not very good as some parts are here and there with hacks here and there. Also it is very slow,\u003cbr\u003e\nreally struggling around 60fps on i7.\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom Volition videos (usually some random devs chit-chat) I‚Äôve learned that it is usually done differently,\u003cbr\u003e\nso AI is priority-queued. So I want that so close characters have higher priority and react faster than distant ones. But this doesn‚Äôt fit into model I have. Also the above presentation lead me to idea that I need several types of AI which should be switcheable on runtime.\u003cbr\u003e\nIn addition I need to add AI-LODS and physics-LODS and animation-LODs to save on distant characters.\u003cbr\u003e\nDoing all of the above requires me to completely rewrite logic, especially object model. As I‚Äôm prototyping I use AngelScript for that. Any ideas how can I organize my object model so I have enough flexibility to extend farther?\u003cbr\u003e\nAny suggestions on where to go and what to read?\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-03-03T12:56:21.550Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":17,"reads":39,"readers_count":38,"score":92.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":2845,"topic_slug":"organizing-npcs-in-game","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022411/Massive-Crowd-on-Assassin-s","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"GDC
