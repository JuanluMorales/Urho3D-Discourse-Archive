External logic controllers work on individual components or sets of components (ie, a logic system that would work only on entities that have HealthComponent, PositionComponent, and PlayerComponent). A classic example of this would be the Artemis Entity-Component system (Which I have used for several Android apps).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogic-Drive: Components hold their own logic. They can communicate with other components that may or may not be there. Components hold their own data, but generally make it available to other components for use. I’ve used several such systems back when I worked with Ogre3D, but I don’t remember any significant players in this area. Urho3D is generally geared towards this type of system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the main thing to note is that components can have logic, but you aren’t forced to do so. You can have a Component on the Scene root managing your logic, or you can have a Subsystem to manage your logic. What works best depends on what you’re trying to accomplish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, I’ve found it best for my card game to include Scene-level components to manage the scene-wide logic. However if I wanted to have a PlayerComponent to handle controlling a Player object, I would probably put all of the controller logic within the component and attach it directly to the player’s Node.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor what you’re trying to accomplish, do so by creating different components. Looking at how physics is handled is probably the best way to model your system off of. After-all, there are multiple components necessary to defining a Physics object, so you can see how those components deal with not having the other required components on a node. PhysicsWorld shows you how to manage all of these objects from the scene’s root level. I would imagine your implementation would follow rather closely to how existing systems are handled.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":3,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:00:45.859Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":4,"reads":8,"readers_count":7,"score":21.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":479,"topic_slug":"agent-actor-entity-system","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":80,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false}],"stream":[2624,2625,2630]},"timeline_lookup":[[1,2966]],"suggested_topics":[{"id":7344,"title":"Do
