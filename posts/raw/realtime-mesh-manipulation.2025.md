Does anyone have any example of mesh manipulation within Urho3D? I'm trying to make a simple tool that allows me to translate vertices on a model by clicking on them and dragging. It's just a start for a small in-game level editing tool, inspired by things like [assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/11919](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/11919) and Sauerbraten.

So, in order to change a single vertex, i have to resubmit all of them? Also, is it possible to render a gizmo on it? Thanks a lot for the help!
