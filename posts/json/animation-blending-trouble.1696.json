Thanks for the link ,  some of the problems are now solved , at least now i can actually STOP the animation by NOT UPDATING it.However this still isn’t what i want.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis way i have to update and control everything manually , which is even more painful and will end up with same result as AnimationController.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem is the blending is controlled via \u003ca href=\"http://weights.So\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eweights.So\u003c/a\u003e lest say i play the walk animation with weight = 1.0f it means the animation is fully weighted and played properly.If i set the weight to 0.5f the transformation is calculated between the Model’s T Pose and the walk animation. Thats the problem i can’t bypass ! What i want is when i play another animation , the AnimationController STOP playing the animation on the specific layer AND remember the current bone matrices and start the blending from this frame to the new animation’s beginning , then play thye new animation (As i remember that’s how animation blending worked in irrlicht)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlending animations by fading out weights will cause the AnimatedModel “go” into T Pose at some point and you can only control “how much” to go into T Pose by higher/lower weight \u003ca href=\"http://value.It\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003evalue.It\u003c/a\u003e would be useful to Stop the current animation so the Model Freezes at this frame.\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrently if you stop an animation the AnimatedModel will go into the T pose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-b\"\u003eEDIT\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell for now i found a bit hacky solution but it just works perfectly.
