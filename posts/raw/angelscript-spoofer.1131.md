Isn't the ScriptCompiler in the tools directory already does something similar. It can dump the AngelScript API bindings into an artificial header file called "AngelScriptAPI.h". I reckon its output format can be easily changed to XML or anything else.

Interesting... Maybe using this Urho3D could be changed so that it uses SWIG for easy binding to many languages.
