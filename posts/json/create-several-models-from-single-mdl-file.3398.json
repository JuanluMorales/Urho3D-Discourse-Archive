I have create an object model under Blender and I would like to use that single model to create several objects within my application.\u003cbr\u003e\nI create N nodes and for each one, I create a static model from the resource related to the model file “Models/Gate.mdl”.\u003cbr\u003e\nHere is the code snippet I use…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003efor(i = 0; i \u0026lt; 10; i++)\n{\n  Node *myNode = mScene-\u0026gt;CreateChild(\"Gate\" + String(i));\n  myNode-\u0026gt;SetPosition(Vector(…, …, …));\n  StaticModel *myModel = myNode-\u0026gt;CreateComponent\u0026lt;StaticModel\u0026gt;();\n  myModel-\u0026gt;SetModel(mResourcesCache-\u0026gt;GetResource\u0026lt;Model\u0026gt;(\"Models/Gate.mdl\"));\n  myModel-\u0026gt;ApplyMaterialList();\n}\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, when I execute that code, I have some strange behaviors when I look at the objects. It seems that sometimes or depending on my camera position, some are visible and other are not, and they appear and disappear in a random fashion.\u003cbr\u003e\nSo my main question is : is it possible (and maybe relevant) to create several objects from the same unique resource ? Do I have to duplicate the model resource to have one duplicated resource associated with one node ? I mean that if I create 10 nodes, do I have to create 10 different resources of the same model ?\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is a little bit confusing to me, so any clarifications would be very welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy best regards !\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-07-31T07:19:22.615Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":10,"reads":39,"readers_count":38,"score":62.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":3398,"topic_slug":"create-several-models-from-single-mdl-file","display_username":"Charles","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":527,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":19714,"name":"","username":"Dave82","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/dave82/{size}/2369_2.png","created_at":"2017-07-31T07:42:46.336Z","cooked":"\u003caside class=\"quote\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"3398\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/zedraken/40/328_1.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003e zedraken:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eis it possible (and maybe relevant) to create several objects from the same unique resource ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbsolutely !.See example20  huge object count.The whole point of resources are to share them whenever possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" I have some strange behaviors when I look at the objects.
