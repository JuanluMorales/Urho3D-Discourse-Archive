Does anyone knows about xcode  project file format, i tried understanding it, it a plist file with some random UIDs but do not fully understand it.
I would like to make a sample xcode and replace paths in it to make a GUI based utility to make project files with templates from "samples" code.
It would be a few click project maker,
