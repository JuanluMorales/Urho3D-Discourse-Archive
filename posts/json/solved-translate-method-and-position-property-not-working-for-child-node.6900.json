In any case, there is a model object that moves as expected if its node position property is set:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003e shieldNode.Position = new Vector3(-2f, 2f, 0f);\n Scene.AddChild(shieldNode);\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, if added to another model object’s node, rather than the scene, the shieldNode model does not budge from zero:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003eshieldNode.Position = new Vector3(-2f, 2f, 0f);\n otherModelNode.AddChild(shieldNode);\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe node Position property is filled correctly, but as stated, the actual model does not move at all. This also occurs with Translate() in local or parent space, though translate works in world space. Rotation and SetWorldPosition() also work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would’ve thought that the .Position property should work within parent space - it does not.
