Hello

I would like to know if there is a way to test a collision of a object. For example, does object a collide with something other then terrain.  The idea I have is to architecture or other landscape related object onto terrain with connecting or intersecting each other.

I looked in the samples folder but I didn't find anything to help.  I am also looking at the Collision class.

The docs is the best primer on physics.

[urho3d.github.io/documentation/H ... ysics.html](http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/HEAD/_physics.html)

Events are sent if collisions happen.

I'll check it out. Oddly, placing objects I can't do a whole look up of collisions with that loop. So, I have to find specific collision for a pertaining object.
