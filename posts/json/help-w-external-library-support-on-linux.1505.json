No problems there. But I’m embarrassed to admit how long I’ve been working to get the cmake system to work properly with Urho3D as an external library, on Linux.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I’ve done:\u003cbr\u003e\nCloned the repo\u003cbr\u003e\ncreated Urho3D/build\u003cbr\u003e\nconfigured cmake via cmake-gui to use build.\u003cbr\u003e\nMade Urho3D into build as a static library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point all the demos in build/bin work without issue. Cool beans! Next I create an external project directory. I reference [http]://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.5/_using_library.html. I specifically note this part of the page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003caside class=\"quote\"\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou must adjust the URHO3D_HOME environment variable in your build.

I’ve tried just about every combination I can imagine and nothing seems to make it happy. Regardless of the assigned value it’s always reset back to ‘Urho3D_DIR-NOTFOUND’. Which I guess it makes sense as the comments imply it should find of the files which has never existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow then, I eventually did get things to work, but that was with actually installing things into /usr/local, via, “make install”, however, that’s not what I desire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, please feel free to kick me in the seat and tell me what I’m doing wrong.
