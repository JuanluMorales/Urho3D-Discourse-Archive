Hi, welcome to the forum!

If you just starting, I would recommend looking into Ninja Snow War and other examples that are avaliable in both C++ and AngleScript.

i not tried it yet but u can take a look at source like bananaft did say.
take a look on the .as and .h ,they are similar

(sample.h, sample.as, helloworld.cpp, helloworld.h and helloworld.as)

you will understand what im saying

oh! it can help you too:
