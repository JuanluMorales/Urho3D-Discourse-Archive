This means in the main update cycle, if a scene was initialized before any application objects subscribed to \u003ccode\u003eE_UPDATE\u003c/code\u003e, the scene will respond to \u003ccode\u003eE_UPDATE\u003c/code\u003e first before those other subscribers. Of course, a scene can technically be initialized anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suppose my question is about best practices around order sequences of responses. If order matters, is it best to use different events that are sent sequentially? Should I assume all responses to an event could be randomly sequenced?
