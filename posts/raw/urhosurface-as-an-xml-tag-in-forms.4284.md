I am new to Urho3D and attempting to take the samples and convert the CS classes to use XAML. I wonder if it is possible to use a XAML tag to reference the UrhoSurface.

In Feature samples you can see the WPF example:

Pretty sure that isn't in WinForms as the title implies. Perhaps I'm missing something??

Many thanks
