My first question is this libUrho3D.a + headers is that the engine? What do i need to develop for urho3d in c++?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have an existing android project which exists out of some activites created with Java, JNI for connecting my c++ code and my c++ core which is responsible for some heavy calculations. Before urho3d i was using a GLSurfaceView which allowed me to dispatch the OpenGL Context via JNI through my c++ core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow can i create a similiar workflow with urho3D? Do i need an SDLActivity like in the examples? Can i then use urho3d in my c++ code.

So i need the Urho3DPlayer.so only for the samples, okay. I looked up your helpful github project and i asked myself, why do you integrate sdl in c++ yourself. Can i also take the prebuilt version from urho3d?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see that you are even building the used joystick sample yourself, this would be the point for my custom code then? I ask because i miss the JNI glue, SDL dispatches events via JNI bindings through native c++ code, sorry if this is obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems SDL doesn’t find it’s nativie c++ method, as i changed from ‘75_JoystickAndroid’ to ‘01_HelloWorld’ i was able to load this prebuilt .so sample but i get an\u003cbr\u003e\njava.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: No implementation found for int org.libsdl.app.SDLActivity.nativeInit\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s weird because i already integrate the prebuilt static libSDL.a. I looked up your SDL_android.c code and tried to integrate this into my app, as i saw that it is the needed c interface. Now i can’t find any SDL header files from their and i saw th prebuilt libSDL.a file from urho doesn’t have any of those headers. This static prebuilt is based only on object files it seems (.o). I am totally confused now… i will try to include headers from sources now, but files like (…/…/video/android/SDL_androidkeyboard.h or …/…/events/SDL_events_c.h) are still missing, they seem not be anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter some experiments i was able to run your code and run the joystick .so sample from my application. But i found another example for SDL on android with version 2 it includes several other files (Sdl, SDLActivity, SDLAudioManager, SDLControllerManager), is this a newer one in comparison to your used version? And why you use urho3D 1.7 has this any specific reason? Also i still have problems trying to compile my own code, when using your SDL_Android.c interface. In the mentioned version 2 it is written that such an interface is not necessary anymore.

Keep in mind you have to copy the whole path to your java src org\\libsdl\\app\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThis activity includes your glue via JNI you will have to extend your own activity from it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAs the SDLActivity wants an executable, you should now add a shared library in cmake based on your source code (E.g. you have a folder in your cpp/renderstuff), name it e.g. ‘render.so’\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSet that name in the activity to be loaded (\u0026lt;-Make sure you have the right SDLActivity, \u003ca class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/lumak\"\u003e@Lumak\u003c/a\u003e has a good SDLActivity for loading one certain .so)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn your setup c++ source code add some urho3d example source code like the hello_gui example\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNow go to the SOURCE of SDL through SDL\\src\\main\\android and copy the SDL_android_main.c \u0026lt;- this are the native callbacks which connects the SDLActivity to your c++ code.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCopy this into your cpp/renderstuff and add the file via cmake to render.so\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInclude headers for urho3d itself and for sdl under include/Urho3D/ThirdParty/ for the SDL_android_main.c file\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn CMake you now have to link urho3d into your render.so\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etarget_link_libraries(render\u003cbr\u003e\nurho3D\u003cbr\u003e\nandroid\u003cbr\u003e\nlog\u003cbr\u003e\nGLESv2\u003cbr\u003e\nz\u003cbr\u003e\n${ROOT_LIBRARIES})\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is it, running the app and starting the activity should load your on the fly compiled render.so.
