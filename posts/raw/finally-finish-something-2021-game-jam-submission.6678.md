I finally finished a presentable project with Urho for the [FFS 2021 jam](https://itch.io/jam/finally-finish-something-2021) (though to  actually call it a finished game may be a stretch). See the submission below.

I liked the lockstep movement system. Something like XCOM apocalypse's system but more practical. [spoiler]Mind if I steal it?[/spoiler]

What cursor mode do you use?
If you use `MM_FREE`, try `MM_ABSOLUTE` instead.

Not at all. If you'd like more details/code just let me know.

I'll have to check. It probably is MM_FREE for most of it, though.
