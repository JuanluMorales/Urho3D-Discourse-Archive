In addition, the physics engine in Urho works with its own update loop and uses timestep internally for its calculations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I missed it in the docs, but what are the rules to when I’m supposed to apply timestep and when not, \u003cstrong\u003ewhen dealing with physics\u003c/strong\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now my rule of thumb is that if the action I do is based on time measured by the timestep, I use it, while if not - I don’t use it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example if I need to apply a single impulse on a rigid body I won’t use timestep. But if I apply a constant force for 10 seconds, which I measure using the timestep, I will apply the timestep factor on every frame I apply the force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs that a correct approach?
