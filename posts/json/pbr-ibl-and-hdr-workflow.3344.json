I also noticed that there is support for high-precision framebuffers for HDR. I am in the process of converting my scene to PBR shaders and the HDR pipeline but I have been having some difficulties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdck-file-uploads-global.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/1X/b8aa1333c1e6b372296d006084f2bb0600226d7f.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"388\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly I must be doing something wrong here. (Note the low saturation) Right now I have the renderer set to hdrRendering=true and have appended BloomHDR and Tonemap to my render path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have read about the advantages of PBR (which in Urho seems to use IBL as well) and HDR in OpenGL rendering, but I am unsure as of now how to set up all my materials and coefficients correctly to achieve a satisfactory result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, what I am asking is what is the current workflow in Urho for making HDR textures (such as skyboxes) and setting realistic lighting parameters. If there are any integral parts that are missing currently, I don’t mind getting my hands dirty, but I would like to know before going further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne last thing, are there any current large-scale projects using these sort of shaders that someone could point me towards for reference?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance,\u003cbr\u003e\n-Don\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-07-13T05:29:27.428Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":205,"reads":67,"readers_count":66,"score":1033.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":3344,"topic_slug":"pbr-ibl-and-hdr-workflow","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":723,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":19410,"name":"","username":"Don","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/don/{size}/755_2.png","created_at":"2017-07-14T05:24:10.482Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eJust bumping this thread.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-07-14T05:24:10.482Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":61,"readers_count":60,"score":17.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":3344,"topic_slug":"pbr-ibl-and-hdr-workflow","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":723,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":19455,"name":"","username":"dragonCASTjosh","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/dragoncastjosh/{size}/774_2.png","created_at":"2017-07-17T11:44:02.407Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003ecan you PM me a copy of your project so i can investigate deeper.
