Hey guys,

I think this needs to be expanded with 3 Subforums, C++, Lua and Angelscript for clarity. Some of us writes prototypes or just scripting and others directly to C++ code. Thanks!  :slight_smile:

I agree with this. It's cluttered the way it is right now.

Ideally code should be in C++, AngelScript and Lua (when relevant), but sharing in only one of them is better than not sharing at all.
