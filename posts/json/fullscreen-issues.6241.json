I 'm trying to run my game in fullscreen but using a smaller resolution : 1280 * 720. At this resolution the screen is always off.The width of the visible area is shorter , leaving a black unused stripe on the right side of the monitor and the height is “longer” . Unfortunately i can’t take a snapshot because it captures only the rendered part leaving the black stripe out of the screenshot…\u003cbr\u003e\nHovever if i change my resolution to 1280 * 768 everything works as expected (no black stripe). But this is a 1.66667 ratio so it doesn’t seem right. Had the same issue with my other GPU too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEDIT tested with NinjaSnowWar and i have the same issue.
