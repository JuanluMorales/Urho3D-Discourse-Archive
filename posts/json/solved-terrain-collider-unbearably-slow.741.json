I got confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I have a simple scene with a rigidbody (capsule collider attached) and a terrain (terrain collider attached).

I have a more than decent processor (an 4 year old intel i7) and I’ve used Terrain Colliders in other engines without a problem. If a Terrain would be so much of a performance killer I don’t think they would exist in any single engine out there nor they would be used in many games.

And keeping the same vertex spacing as in my example but making the capsule smaller makes lag go away.[/quote]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a crazy thought and I don’t know if it’ll work but could you try keeping the scale of the terrain as you had before and \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"bbcode-u\"\u003ethen instead of making the capsule smaller\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e change the physics shape to something other than capsule? like box or mesh ( or maybe make your own semi-capsule but with less curvy detail and using that but set the physics shape to mesh because you are supplying the capsule which bullet wouyld interpret as a mesh ) ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eif the lag goes away or gets better then that may be a work-around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn either case; i suspect that bullet may be doing some extra calculations on the lower-end of the built-in capsule againt the terrain.  This may be due to complex ( lots of smaller ) triangle structure of the terrain. if that’s the case then it would explain why making the terrain’s scale larger removes the lag because then bullet doesn’t have to go through as many calculations.  In that case the easier solution might be to determine what paths your characters would be traveling and make those paths use larger triangles to decrease the amount of physics calculations that bullet needs to do on them…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know if any of that helps or not but good luck.  \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":11,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:02:39.517Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":1,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":15,"readers_count":14,"score":3.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":741,"topic_slug":"solved-terrain-collider-unbearably-slow","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":188,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":4128,"name":"","username":"setzer22","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/ce7236/{size}.png","created_at":"2015-01-15T21:44:09.000Z","cooked":"\u003caside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"devrich\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/d/ba9def/40.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003e devrich:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf that’s the case then it would explain why making the terrain’s scale larger removes the lag because then bullet doesn’t have to go through as many calculations.
