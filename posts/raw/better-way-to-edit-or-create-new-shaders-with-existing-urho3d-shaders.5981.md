So I have a lot of background in shaders. I'm looking to implement some of my shaders I made, for Irrlicht engine a few years ago. 

I have looked at this: https://github.com/dfranx/SHADERed

Right now all I do is open a shader in Notepad++ and add to it. 

It is just a pain to try an setup all the includes and other files that urho3d shaders use. I just want a way to keep it close to Urho that way when I implement the shader in Urho I don't have to make all these tweaks to the shader.

Well guess their is no better way of making shaders for Urho3d other than notepad++.

Pretty much. You could check out https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/dev-workflow-urho3d-blender-used-in-ggj2020/5883 and see if you can salvage any of it.
