Games environment artist Aidy Burrows has released a free Blender shader set-up designed to approximate real-time PBR shading within the Blender viewport. I think it might be useful to preview Urho's PBR in Blender.
This is the link to the shader:  [url]http://www.cgmasters.net/free-tutorials/realtime-pbr-in-blender/[/url]
