So, for the Urho3D library, it could build for both 32-bit/64-bit iPhoneSimulator and ARM archs. Having said that, our build server is rather slow with a maximum of 50 minutes (limit for non-paying Travis-CI customers) to complete a build job or the job would be killed prematurely, and what makes the matter worse is the build server performance varies depending on the sever load through out the day. So, we have a set of build rules to avoid our build job to be killed in this manner by skipping some of non-critical build processes and universal binary build is one of those and as the result some of the iOS build artifacts only contains binary for iPhoneSimulator archs. It is also unfortunate that we realized we had a small glitch while we pushed 1.4 tag which prevented us from doing a universal binary build. The glitch has been fixed since then in our master branch, I believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have two ways to solve your problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[ol]\u003cbr\u003e\n[li] Clone from the master branch and build from source.[/li]\u003cbr\u003e\n[li] If for some reason you don’t want to build from source while evaluating Urho3D then you can download one of our latest snapshots artifacts after the 1.4 release.
