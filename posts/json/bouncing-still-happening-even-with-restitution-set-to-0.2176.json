The camera (the player view) is initially located above the terrain and when the simulation starts, the camera falls down until it collides with the terrain.\u003cbr\u003e\nThen, the camera starts gliding around on the terrain depending on the slope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the implementation details given here (like setting the linear velocity to 0), I just want to be sure if I do it the right way. I mean that to have a first person view, I use the camera for which I create a rigid body with a collision shape. I give the camera a mass and a friction factor (I tried high values).\u003cbr\u003e\nThus, I manage the UP and DOWN keys along with the mouse orientation to make the camera move forward in the view direction. Note that is that case, the mouse also gives the vertical orientation of the camera.\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, like you, I am unable to stop the gliding movement, although I implemented the solution you propose (setting up a collision start event handler). Thus, when moving forward by pressing the UP key which is for making the player (the camera) move forward, I am able to cross some terrain parts which have a slope and be on the other side (below the terrain), which makes the camera fall down for the eternity.\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, my questions are :\u003cbr\u003e\n1 - is it the best solution to implement a first person view walking on a terrain or is there a better way to achieve it ?\u003cbr\u003e\n2 - if I do it the right way, is there an ‚Äúelegant‚Äù solution for removing the gliding movement, having a simple walk movement based on pressing a ‚Äúmove forward‚Äù key, and using the mouse to give the camera direction ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can provide more details (code snippets) if needed.
