We build enterprise apps. Often we need to add 3D rendering of content (not game related) to our mobile applications and typically the 3D rendering is only a part/feature of a much larger mobile application.  In the past we used Unity and more recently also Ogre3D to do the job.  These engine integrate very well with native UI mobile applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recently discovered Urho3D and I‚Äôm really impressed with the quality of this software project. I would love to try the Urho3D engine on our mobile applications.\u003cbr\u003e\nBut unfortunately after a short investigation of the engine I came to the conclusion that ‚Äònone fullscreen‚Äô mode on for example iOS is not supported. To be more precise: after a small debugging session on iOS using the \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003eengineParameters_[‚ÄúExternalWindow‚Äù] \u003c/span\u003e param, eventually the \u003cspan class=\"bbcode-i\"\u003eSDL_CreateWindowFrom\u003c/span\u003e function internally calls the [i]SDL_Unsupported\u003ca\u003e/i\u003c/a\u003e function.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned other engines like Ogre3D integrate very well. For example on iOS, we have a UIView that embeds the Ogre3D engine. This UIView class can be added to a parent UIView.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilar to Urho3D, Ogre3D needs to be initialized with a NameValuePair table. But here you need to add both the main window handle (UIWindow*) and the parent View  control (UIView*). Like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003e \nOgre::NameValuePairList params;\nparams[\"externalWindowHandle\"] = ((unsigned long)appUIWindowPtr);\nparams[\"externalViewHandle\"] = ((unsigned long)parentUIViewPtr); \u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be fantastic if we could also embed Urho3D as a sub-view inside existing mobile applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheers,\u003cbr\u003e\nMike Slembrouck\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:13:03.901Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":82,"reads":25,"readers_count":24,"score":415.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":2097,"topic_slug":"urho3d-as-subview-embedded-in-native-mobile-application","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://pegusapps.com","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"PegusApps - Enterprise Apps: Mobile Apps, IoT, Wearables.
