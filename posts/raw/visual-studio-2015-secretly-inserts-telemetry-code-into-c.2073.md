[quote]Our intent was benign ? our desire was to build a framework that will help investigate performance problems and improve the quality of our optimizer should we get any reports of slowdowns or endemic perf problems in the field.[/quote]

That's an eloquent way of putting it. Translation: "We are spying on your application without your knowledge and probably impeding performance while doing so."

They should have at least informed the devs that this existed. But no, instead they snuck this "feature" into the compiler without anyone's knowledge...
