But I have an extra information which may be valuable to you. Based on the above line, I believe you might have tried Gradle build with Android SDK locally installed in your Windows host system too. If so, then your previous attempt may have generated a file called “local.properties” at the project root. You need to delete this file so that it does not interfere and let the Gradle Android plugin (in the DBE) regenerates it with the correct bundled SDK installation path. So, this should at least fix that problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is still other problems with your attempt though, for example the value 1234 for the HOST_UID and HOST_GID in my README are really just a placeholder that needs to be substituted with the actual UID and GID of your account at the host system (a notion that does not exist on Windows). They are needed so that all the build artifacts generated during DBE run can be set to be owned by this UID:GID, making them accessible by host user after the container has ended the run, i.e. making them virtually indistinguishable from conventional build artifact. Having said that, since Windows system does not have this UID:GID notion, it may work accidentally too as Windows may just let whoever the host user to access the generated build artifacts.
