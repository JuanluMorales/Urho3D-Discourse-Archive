Hello,
I am having a problem importing an fbx animation into urho3d. The root node seems to be weirdly rotated for some reason.

Here is a screenshot showing the problem. On the left is a StaticModel and AnimatedModel on right, both using same model.

Here is a link to fbx file:

Also, I checked the axis and it is Y Up. It works fine in Unity. So maybe it's an issue with assimp?

Any idea why it is acting strange?

Thanks.
