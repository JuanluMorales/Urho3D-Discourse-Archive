All spec files are auto generated by CMake. As it is, it already can produce Linux packages for deb and rpm. It even already has the /usr/lib vs /usr/lib64 taken care of for 64-bit packages. Having said that, as it is now, I reckon they are nowhere near to be accepted. Not that I have tried though. There are a few reasons for that. One of them is that our packaging approach is monolitic instead one package for source, one for lib, one for doc, one for samples, and may be one more for static lib (they like shared lib by default). I also think the way Urho3D embeds those third-party libs might be an issue to them. I am not saying what we have done is wrong though. Whenever there is a bug in the 3rd-party lib or there is a Urho3D-specific need for local adaptation then it is faster to do all that in our own copy of those 3rd-party libraries rather than submitting the changes up and then wait for upstream to decide and respond. This approach is fine when Urho3D lib is just a localized library used by some game apps. But I think it is a fat chance to have it becomes a first class citizen as one of the system-wide libraries this way. This is my personal opinion from my experience with Fedora distro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTechnical aside, There is also issue with man power to back port bug fixes from master branch to existing release branches. At the moment we all know Urho3D devs don’t do that at all. And I don’t think that is acceptable on any Linux distros, especially Debian one. Or to put it in another words, whoever the person becomes the Linux package maintainer for Urho3D then that person must assume the back porter role.
