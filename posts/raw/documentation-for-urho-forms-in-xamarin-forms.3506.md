I am looking for documentation for Urho.Forms & Urho3d

I am able to create scene Load 3d model (mdl) file - (But I don't have any idea on how the mdl file is created)

I am also able to rotate & create touch point on it. 

**What I am looking for is how to on Material & texture from scratch.**

_Unfortunately you might not be able to get much help on Urho.Forms here as that is a different project that has its own forum._

Though you can create Materials from scratch, either within the engine or even write it out with a basic text editor, I would not advice you to go that route. [This](https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/recommended-3d-editor-for-urho3d/1602) discussion would give you a bit of an idea of the workflow to adopt
