I thought i share my current work and share the headaches i went through to have a good looking texture.First of all i had to find wooden ornate textures , which was pretty hard in first place.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf the texture isn’t too small then it was shot from a wrong angle which makes it useless.Once i found the textures that meet the criteria then i had to adjust contrast , color , brightness and buch of other factors to make all the different textures match and look the same…The next thing i will buy is a pro camera , make some photos of an old desk and after a few minutes of editing it is ready to use.This is the main problem that slows down my project.Searching for textures and editing them to fit in the game is an extremely slow process\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e          \u003ca href=\"https://i.postimg.cc/mrqWpGgv/desk.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" class=\"onebox\"\u003e\n            \u003cimg src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/mrqWpGgv/desk.jpg\" width=\"664\" height=\"500\"\u003e\n          \u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2019-02-04T16:44:44.288Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":2,"reads":11,"readers_count":10,"score":12.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":2274,"topic_slug":"carved-desk-modelling","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":2,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://i.postimg.cc/mrqWpGgv/desk.jpg","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"desk.jpg","clicks":0}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":247,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":14323,"name":"","username":"bukkits","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/b/848f3c/{size}.png","created_at":"2016-11-05T22:15:06.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eI’ve always wondered what the best process is for finding and creating textures as an independent artist.

and other sites that are guaranteed to be free and no license required.CGTextures is currently the best , and bigest texture site i know with the most permissive license so far.All these textures have good and bad sides.Well one of the good sides is apparently that the textures are free.The bad thing is you must edit them a lot for use them in games (seamless , contrast , saturation ,
