Since URHO can only support one context per application, the only solution that I would see fit would be to integrate ways to have a main application launch client application and interact between these process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe could use the network as a start, but I would prefer to have a direct communication between apps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve seen there are some interprocess libraries that could facilitate the work a lot (cppremote, boost, d-bus). I know barely nothing on this, I will look how its done and will try to seek for a tutorial about this, but it would be nice that URHO would have this ability and a little example (could be similar as the network example). This would also help the EDITOR have sub-editor modules to expand its capability.
