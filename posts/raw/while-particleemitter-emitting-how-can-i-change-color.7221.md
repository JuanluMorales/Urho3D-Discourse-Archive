Are you trying to get the random colors or make them all the same color?

I may be wrong, but I don't think there is a way to do it nicely in Urho. This is one of the many limitations I find in the particle system. 

My suggestion would be to just copy the whole class and edit your `RainbowParticleEmitter` class to randomize particle color in addition to the position and scale and such.
