I decided to give Urho some wheels:

Urho has been approved as [**Super Tux Kart**](https://supertuxkart.net) add-on which you can download in-game to take his Stingray for a spin. Two of the current default mascots turned out to not be free culture (Hexley and Beastie) so I'm hoping Urho and/or _Toots_ will qualify.

They grow up so fast. :slightly_smiling_face: 

Yes.

Both are work-in-progress, btw: Urho is not animated beyond steering yet, and the back of Toots' kart is still somewhat open/undetermined.

Well, STK *did* already have Puffy.

So I didn't introduce the concept of a driving fish to STK. But maybe that's where _the researchers_ got the idea from. :slight_smile:
Urho controls his kart using a handle that fits his tail.
