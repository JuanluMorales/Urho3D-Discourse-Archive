Perhaps for a real-time engine some kind of deformation modifier stack could be made that works like the render-path system where it is data-driven but defines an order of deformers which is abstract enough to do things like GPU transform feedbacks for you or generates a special ‘uber’ vertex shader (or perhaps compute shaders or uses a CPU approach that uses something like ISPC with a fast upload path to GPU with glBufferSubData fallback) for you that combines all of your deformers which need to be applied to your model.
