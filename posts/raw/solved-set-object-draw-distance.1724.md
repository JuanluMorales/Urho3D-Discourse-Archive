Hey Lichi,

Actually, a simple grass system is quite easy to implement in Urho3D and managing draw distance. You can check out more about that here: [urho3d.github.io/documentation/1 ... 68bc7a696c](http://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.5/class_urho3_d_1_1_drawable.html#a6fa21af838026c1566496968bc7a696c)

Hope that helps :slight_smile:
