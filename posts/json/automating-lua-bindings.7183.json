Why not just discontinue Lua?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither way, I have had a very good experience with Sol2 and I would very much recommend it, if you do decide to continue support for Lua.  Sol2 has tons of nice features and writing bindings using it doesn’t feel too much like a chore since it’s readable unlike tolua++\u003cbr\u003e\nSure tolua++ can generate automatic bindings but I wouldn’t want to ever use them again.\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy write a script to vomit out total trash while spawning hard to trace bugs, if you can just write good bindings in the first place?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dev for sol2 is pretty active, I recall reading somewhere they might be working on automatic binding generator already, but it’s been a while so I can’t link and I don’t think it will be ready anytime soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever as it is right now, I would never use the Lua side of Urho3D again and discourage anyone else to use it at all. The hiccups in the web Lua samples should have been a warning loud enough for me to stay away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy apologies for being so negative, but I have a really sour taste in my mouth considering I have wasted a considerable amount of time dealing with these types of bugs and I feel that if I didn’t voice my opinion more resources would be wasted on terrible buggy bindings that will mislead other devs into wasting time just like I have.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":8,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2022-02-06T18:46:56.951Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":1,"reads":27,"readers_count":26,"score":60.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":7183,"topic_slug":"automating-lua-bindings","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":3}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1201,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":44624,"name":"J Tippetts","username":"JTippetts1","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/jtippetts1/{size}/96_2.png","created_at":"2022-02-06T20:35:50.191Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThe original bindings were done using tolua++, a basically defunct bindings library and the source of most of the problems eg memory stuff, and the reason that they need to be redone.
