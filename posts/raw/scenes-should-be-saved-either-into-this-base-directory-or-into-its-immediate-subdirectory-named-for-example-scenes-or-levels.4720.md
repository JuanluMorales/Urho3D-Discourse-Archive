The documentation has the statement:

> Scenes should be saved either into this base directory, or into its immediate subdirectory, named for example Scenes or Levels.

Why is this exactly? When I place a scene in a deeper folder it can't find resources but if I move the same file in a Scenes folder everything works fine.
