Version 3.9.0 will be released \u003ca href=\"https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390a3/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003elate this year\u003c/a\u003e.  The Python community is split between versions 2.x and 3.x of the language, with various vested interests refusing to move forwards.  This schism happened quite awhile ago, as Python 3.0 was released in December 2008.  Python 2.7.x was officially given \u003ca href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eend-of-life on January 1, 2020\u003c/a\u003e, with version 2.7.18 code frozen at that time.  It will actually be released in mid-April, 2020.  There will never be a Python 2.8.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy talk about Python, when Urho3D already has its hands full with Lua and AngelScript?  Because improving things with either of those languages is not easy or some kind of “free move”.  Lua versions have substantial incompatibilities.  tolua++ would need to be depreciated, so doing a new C++ binding regime while phasing out the old one, is \u003cem\u003ework\u003c/em\u003e.  Bumping the AS version is easy, but I hear that despite its C++ friendliness, no \u003cem\u003eautomated\u003c/em\u003e C++ wrapper exists for it.  I haven’t investigated that yet so YMMV, but \u003cem\u003emanual\u003c/em\u003e labor to produce C++ wrappers, clearly isn’t the equal of an automated regime.  When someone contributes an Urho3D pull request, they often haven’t done AS or Lua bindings, which greatly delays or stops their work from getting into core.  That’s unsustainable.  Whereas with Python, I expect that an automated C++ binding regime is out there, since Python’s ecosystem is large.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePython will never be the performance equal of some of the other scripting language choices.  However it offers something that other languages do not: a \u003cem\u003estrategic ecosystem.\u003c/em\u003e  Python is favored in the 3d modeling and animation world now.  Autodesk has a stranglehold on the market with its 3DSMAX and Maya products, both of which do Python nowadays.  It’s Python \u003cem\u003e2.x\u003c/em\u003e, which is regrettable, but it’s still Python.  When I last checked on it, there was not a peep out of them about ever moving forwards, but that was some time ago.  Maybe official end-of-life will get them moving someday?  Maybe it’ll depend on what their paying customers actually clamor for, so they’ll sloooowly get around to it.  I don’t expect the 2.x holdouts to manage their stubbornness forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Blender 2.80 is using Python 3.x.  I believe it’s 3.5.  Python numbering culture is that minor releases don’t break anything.  3.x is 3.x is 3.x.  If a Blender person wanted to start banging on Urho3D, I can’t reasonably expect any problems for them to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe popular Godot 3D engine, which I’m sure many of you realize is sucking the air out of the room for projects like Urho3D, uses a bastardized Python called GDScript.  It’s not real Python.  For me personally that’s a dealbreaker.  I’m not trusting my game scripting content to some rinky dink one shot engine developer!  I’ve got complex coding stuff in mind, and the only things I’m going to use are either a standard language, or \u003cem\u003emy own\u003c/em\u003e language, which I don’t actually have implemented at this time.  There’s no reasonable future for GDScript outside of Godot, it is simply not a career skill or valuable in the marketplace.  Python 3.x, in contrast, is something that people can reuse for all sorts of things and \u003cem\u003emake money at\u003c/em\u003e, while they’re trying to survive as indie game developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy other reasons for rejecting Godot are it’s 2D oriented, mobile oriented, and not strong at 3D.  Pity, as their development effort has other strengths going for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanging up the UI of a game in Python 3.x is a sane idea.  As a lone wolf indie, I need to have this sort of thing.  Banging it up in Lua isn’t a horrible idea, for instance Blizzard did it for World of Warcraft, but it does beg questions about which version of Lua.  Picking a Lua isn’t a free move, because of the C++ binding issue.  I have no doubt in my mind, that Python is better suited to larger scale applications development, than Lua is.  Witness Blender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, from an ecosystem standpoint, I don’t really see AS as even a contender.  I don’t want to undermine an extant ecosystem, as it’s important to preserve existing user base.  But really, if you’re sitting down to write something important, why AS rather than Python 3.x?  I don’t see any money or life blood coming from that.  The world of 3d modeling and animation has pretty much voted on what works, and it’s Python.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven’t even checked on whether anyone forked Urho3D to do any kind of Python.  For the record I’m also not interested in “collect all languages” binding efforts.  I talk about Python because it has specific strategic value, that other languages don’t have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn particular, I have no interest in C#.  If you want that, I have no idea why you’re not using Unity.  And if \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e isn’t good enough, I have no idea why you’re not doing \u003ca href=\"https://www.neoaxis.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eNeoAxis\u003c/a\u003e.  It came from Ogre3D, some dev who said “I wanna do C#!” and also said, he wanted to get \u003cem\u003epaid\u003c/em\u003e to sustain it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC# is not a scripting language, you can’t just interpret it in plain text and have your results immediately available for your prototyping.  It’s the tedious compile cycle drill, and it doesn’t offer anything interesting as a language, for someone whose tastes might run more towards Lisp or Forth.  In any event there are plenty of “new devs coming up”, who really only know C# as their world, who want to go do stuff in C#.  There are plenty of open source 3d projects already doing that sort of thing.  Between those and Unity absorbing the vast majority of game devs, I see no motive whatsoever, to try to compete with anyone on a C# basis.  It’s \u003cem\u003esuicide\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Jonathan Blow finally ships \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Blow#JAI_language\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eJai\u003c/a\u003e, we’ll talk about that.  I hear some early betas are going around now.  But we’re also 5.5 years out, and it isn’t here yet.  And I didn’t get my own language done either.  So here we are, talking about what to do with Urho3D scripting.  Looking over the archives, I’m surprised that my first minimal involvement with Urho3D was over 4 years ago.  Some CMake build bug stuff.  I probably had just finished my cleanup of the moribund Ogre3D ecology and ditched it.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2020-02-17T21:54:42.443Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":45,"reads":53,"readers_count":52,"score":235.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":5932,"topic_slug":"interest-in-python-3-8-and-3-9","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Blow#JAI_language","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Jonathan Blow - Wikipedia","clicks":5},{"url":"https://www.neoaxis.com/","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"NeoAxis Engine","clicks":1},{"url":"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"PEP 373 -- Python 2.7 Release Schedule | Python.org","clicks":0},{"url":"https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390a3/","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Python Release Python 3.9.0a3 | Python.org","clicks":0}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":294,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":36176,"name":"SirNate0","username":"SirNate0","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/9f8e36/{size}.png","created_at":"2020-02-17T22:02:53.822Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eI’m interested in Python 3.x support.

Microsoft \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e integrated the C# side of its business strategy, with the C++ DirectX game development side of things.  First there was Managed DirectX, and then they pulled the plug on that.  Then there was XNA, and they pulled the plug on that.  I never had any real interest in what Mono was doing, so when they started having trouble, and then subsequently got help (? buyout?) from Microsoft, I really didn’t care.  I was interested in F# for a time, which is an OCaml derivative.  It was always historically too awkward to deal with the DirectX COM interface binding problem.  After years and years of occasionally poking at this, I gave up trying.  I just accepted that if I got back into DirectX’s orbit again, I would have to deal with C++.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this kind of blase background, I’ve been totally unaware of C# interpreters such as CS-Script.  That solves one problem, which is seeing results immediately.  Let me guess though: performance isn’t anything to write home about?  Like doesn’t buy you anything over Python.  Is your debugging life any easier, crossing a compiled C# to interpreted C# boundary?  Not gonna be shocked if it isn’t, but you tell me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t like C#, Java, or C++.  I’m not stuck with the first 2, so I don’t deal with them.  C++, DirectX on Windows pretty much forces me to deal with it.  Otherwise I wouldn’t.  I’ve chased \u003cem\u003emany\u003c/em\u003e languages over the years, seeking a C++ replacement.  The problem is, those languages always turn out to be run by academics, or single developers who abandon their projects.  They get to some OpenGL at best, which isn’t even important anymore.  Never do these efforts really intersect the Windows DirectX game industry.  Those people just keep chugging along with C++, with some C# inroads.  And Microsoft never pushes C# as a good fit for DirectX development, the support simply isn’t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe someday Jonathan Blow will save us all with Jai.

Too much bondage and discipline and not solving the real problems of a game developer.  I’ve checked on the Rust 3d engine ecosystem occasionally, and last I looked sometime last year, I didn’t see anything compelling.  I always leave myself room to be surprised, but it’s been \u003cem\u003eawhile\u003c/em\u003e now and I haven’t seen anything compelling coming from that direction.  Especially if DirectX is a hard requirement.  Not saying they don’t ever deal with it, but there’s way too much OpenGL DNA in most open source projects.

I have trouble visualizing how much that matters for a game developer.  Or a VFX developer, since a lot of my argument is about attracting that crowd, to get more bodies into Urho3D’s door.  There’s not really a 3d game development ecosphere to understand with Python, it’s not something game developers do.

Cython’s other proof of concept seems to be in scientific batch processing work.

If Python performance is an issue, then we prefer the use of Cython followed by C, C++ or Fortran (in that order). The main motivation for this is maintainability: Cython has the highest abstraction level, and most Python developers will understand it. C is also widely known, and easier for the current core development team to manage than C++ and especially Fortran.« → \u003ca href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0686-2\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ePauli Virtanen et al., SciPy\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you can surely get a scientist to follow the Cython drill \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e but that doesn’t imply a VFX person would do it.
