The Terrain class is a component. As all the other components, you would usually need it to be attached to other node rather than to the root scene node directly, although there are exception. The Editor does not know what is user intention when creating a new component, it simply attach the newly created component to the “current” node. If your current node happens to be a root “Scene” node then the Editor will just dutifully attach it there. That is, before creating components, you should create the node hierarchy first. RigidBody and CollisionShape are components too, so the above also apply to them. They can only be attached to a node and not to the “Terrain” itself. I hope I did not misinterpret your question and that my reply answers your question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003caside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"rogerdv\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/r/eb8c5e/40.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003e rogerdv:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe same heightmap produces different results in bot cases\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot sure if I understand your statement.
