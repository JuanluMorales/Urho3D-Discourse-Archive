Hello ,

I am having issues with multitouch input on mobile devices, where my touch input lags quite a bit that it is noticeable. I happens on all of the samples. Is there any good way on debugging this or tweaking somewhere some constants ? I played with the touch sensitivity but It didn't help a lot. I am testing on IOS mobile device.

Thanks,

Alex
