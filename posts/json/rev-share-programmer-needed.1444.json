The premise is you go through a jump gate. Ship destroyed you being the lonely survival managed to build a mini starbase that you have to build out and crafting out a station. This is what I have already that I‚Äôll openly discuss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1_5on457AU\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eyoutube.com/watch?v=u1_5on457AU\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like the idea of exploration. So one race will be prinarily science and engineering, with some tactical military and the other pure science and engineering with math logic. As must of the civilizations are planned out as I am working on the stripped down ui. The video shows the resource system, power systems, interact components, Drone AI, UI, and draft models I did and textures. The video shows the programming IDE and language I am using. I will post a recent UI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are the things need. I need a programmer especially.  Concept art for starbases, races, and ships - Basic models of the previous with basic texture - Lore, story, and basic dialog creation - Coding to complete resource system, activities, and other management of game resources - Characters and other entity AI coding and testing - Camera system for ingame machina and animation recording\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have a portfolio or samples. I can be contacted at \u003ca href=\"mailto:cgprojectsfx@gmail.com\"\u003ecgprojectsfx@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings like character implementation has been made but not added yet. I‚Äôve been mainly getting the game mechanic client and server made, plus super bare bone models. The object interactions works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeel free to forward to someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVivienne\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:07:45.413Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":7,"reads":13,"readers_count":12,"score":37.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":1444,"topic_slug":"rev-share-programmer-needed","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1_5on457AU","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Hangar Test Build Running Client and Server - YouTube","clicks":12}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":88,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":8303,"name":"","username":"practicing01","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/p/b5e925/{size}.png","created_at":"2015-10-26T01:19:34.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eA detailed list of models needed would be nice.
