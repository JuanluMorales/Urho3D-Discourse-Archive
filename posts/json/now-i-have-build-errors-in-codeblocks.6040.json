If it is not a red error it should still build (unless it is a component you want/need installed - you can seIect those in the CMake configuration above the log). can’t remember if it is necessary for Urho, but perhaps you need to download\u0026amp;install WinSDK and or other libraries, e.g. SDL but I think it all comes with the Urho package.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe thirdparty Networking dependencies caused a lot of issues for me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFix\u003c/strong\u003e: Since I don’t need networking I just unchecked URHO3D -\u0026gt; URHO3D_NETWORK in the CMake options. If you need it, you need to check the errors during building. E.g. civetweb had undeclared uintptr_t usages and iirc there was also some issue where windows headers where not included the code files (and then I stopped bothering and just disabled it). Tweaking the thirdparty code files will fix it though.
