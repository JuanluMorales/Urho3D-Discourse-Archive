It is caused by your host operating system. Are you using 64-bit Debian or Ubuntu? I guess that the error: “/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu” means the linker was looking for 32-bit version of the library but found a 64-bit one. Remember that at the moment when you targeting Android platform, your build is always 32-bit. This is also true when you build Urho3D for Android platform regardless of the URHO3D_64BIT build option that you pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy recommendation. Get a 32-bit Debian or 32-bit Ubuntu when you want to build for Android. Or, get a 64-bit Fedora but install both 32-bit and 64-bit software development packages. If my guess on why you got this problem in the first place is correct then in theory you should be able to install 32-bit devel packages into your 64-bit Debian/Ubuntu and it should also solve your problem, however, that would or might whack your 64-bit part out for good in your host system (speaking from past experience using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS VM). In my opinion Debian-based distros still do not have good multi-arch support where the same 64-bit host system has both 32-bit arch and 64-bit arch libraries coexist. Not intended to start a flame war here but 64-bit Fedora system does a much better job at this kind of scenario.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":6,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:00:08.768Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":4,"readers_count":3,"score":0.8,"yours":false,"topic_id":398,"topic_slug":"how-to-build-luajit","display_username":"Yao Wei Tjong","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"Admin","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":true,"staff":true,"user_id":4,"hidden":false,"trust_level":4,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":2148,"name":"","username":"friesencr","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/friesencr/{size}/827_2.png","created_at":"2014-08-25T03:03:57.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eI had troubles with luajit for the android too.
