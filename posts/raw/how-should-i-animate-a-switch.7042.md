I have no skills with 3D animation. If I wanted to create a switch with a base and a lever, then it seems like I need two separate models (as opposed to one model with a bone). I can parent the lever to the base and get the animation working in blender, but the export to fbx and subsequent import into Urho3D only contains the parent (base) and not the child (lever).

Am I supposed to export and load two separate models in Urho? And if so, then is it still possible to make use of the animations exported from blender, or do I need to manually rotate the node in the scene?
