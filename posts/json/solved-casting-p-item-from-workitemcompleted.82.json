The WorkQueue has initially been used only for the Renderer’s internal tasks and the completion event facility has been an afterthought, so using them is not as convenient as it should be.

You should not make another WorkQueue on your own, as that creates another batch of (number of CPUs) worker threads which may be too much.

The other method and one which I’m leaning towards could be something like:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003eWorkItem item;\n// Do stuff.\nSharedPtr\u0026lt;WorkItem\u0026gt; reference = WorkQueue::AddItem(item);\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’d have to do some conversions from the reference to copy the details from the passed reference to a free SharedPtr but it would mean that we could ensure all allocations were part of the pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course both would share behind the scenes stuff such as a separate queue for currently queued items and assigned items which wouldn’t change much between the current format. I’ll have a play see what comes out of it, the big question would be on when would it be safe to shrink the queue down, perhaps maintain a delta between frames of the number of used / requested items and if it lasts then shrink down to remove one time or infrequent usage of the WorkQueue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo had a play and decided that I prefer the
