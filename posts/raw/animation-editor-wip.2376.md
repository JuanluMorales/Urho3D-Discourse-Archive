Hi!
I'm not really good at animating in Blender yet, so I decided to create a simple built-in Animation Editor. Of course its not complete yet, but I just show it here, maybe somebody has some idea what to implement for it.

Warning! UI is looks like crap yet, and full of useless things! :smiley:

Nice. It's a tough project.
Looking forward to the finished project :slight_smile:
