However, I added a few enhancements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst enhancement was adding a ConvexPruneObject class which as the name suggests prunes nav tiles as untraversable, as shown by the magenta tiles shown in fig 1 and fig 2. This came about after observing that creating a huge Obstacles lacked features that I needed. Querying for nearest path inside an obstacle (position of the white box shown in fig 2) returned a tile inside the obstacle.  By pruning the unwanted tiles, the nearest position is acquired outside the convex object.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond enhancement was loading nav tiles from file and load them in a single contiguous memory instead of building the nav mesh at load time.  In my simple scene, it takes about 1.4 seconds to build the navmesh and it takes less than 1 msec. to load tiles from file and rebuild it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird simple enhancement - for navmesh to ignore nodes with ‚Äúignore‚Äù tag used for thing as trigger boxes, small debris, and far off mountains that‚Äôll never get traversed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efig 1.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"//cdck-file-uploads-global.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/1X/ee5246e7947a12bbe7c67f6c2b1e3bd7055d49df.jpg\" alt\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efig 2.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"//cdck-file-uploads-global.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/1X/191b06478df261ce8816391a9a6b3659f958e711.jpg\" alt\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-09-27T17:48:45.791Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":3,"reads":40,"readers_count":39,"score":143.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":3613,"topic_slug":"navigationmesh-convexpruneobject","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":3,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"http://discourse.urho3d.io/t/creating-a-hole-in-navmesh-at-build-time-not-dynamic/3971/6","internal":true,"reflection":true,"title":"Creating a hole in navmesh at build time (not dynamic)","clicks":1}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":4}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":256,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":21030,"name":"","username":"Lumak","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/l/8491ac/{size}.png","created_at":"2017-09-28T16:36:02.818Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eFor anyone new to DynamicNavigationMesh, let me clarify that creating a huge Obstacle was just a test and should not be created for your game levels.
