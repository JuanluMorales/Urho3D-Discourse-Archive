For example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I wanted to write a custom shader and didn’t really understand the documentation I thought: “Time to search the forum”. To my surprise, the word “shader” is too common and the search engine chooses to exclude it from the search, so my searches were not restricted to shader-related topics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had more than a fight with this “too common” feature, and I think everyone would benefit from a more powerful search engine, specially newbies like me, because it’s difficult not to replicate posts when the search ignores most of the keywords.

I host the MinecraftForge sites, build server, forums, file hosting, everything, and can host it on the same server.  The new forum system that we have been setting up and experimenting with for the site design overall is Discourse,  you can see our in-progress tests of it (and feel free to mess with it to see how it works if you want in the meta category) at \u003ca href=\"http://discuss.minecraftforge.net/\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttp://discuss.minecraftforge.net/\u003c/a\u003e.  It is a forum system made by the creator of Stack Overflow designed to be a Stack Overflow style Forum.  I can set you up a new instance if you wish and the instances are portable so if you wanted to move it to a new server of your own sometime then you just install discourse and copy the data directory, that contains \u003cem\u003eeverything\u003c/em\u003e for the site.  Only thing I would need is just some DNS pointed to it (\u003ca href=\"http://discuss.urho3d.org\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ediscuss.urho3d.org\u003c/a\u003e or so?) or I can set up a temporary one (\u003ca href=\"http://urho3d.overminddl1.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eurho3d.overminddl1.com\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"http://urho3d.minecraftforge.net\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eurho3d.minecraftforge.net\u003c/a\u003e or whatever).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiscourse has amazing functionality built in and it is amazingly simple to integrate with external services.  it even has Github integration since it was designed to co-exist with Stack Overflow (see example of github integration at:  \u003ca href=\"http://discuss.minecraftforge.net/t/testing-a-new-topic/14/7?u=overminddl1\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttp://discuss.minecraftforge.net/t/testing-a-new-topic/14/7?u=overminddl1\u003c/a\u003e).
