Essentially if an occludee is completely covered by an occluder in screen-space, then it won’t be rendered.  Say you have a box which is an occluder and a 1,000,000 poly model that is an occludee. If you cannot see the model because it is hidden behind an occluder, then the system doesn’t have to draw those 1,000,000 polys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is good because performance impacts can be localized. A game which takes place in close quarters could have a scene with many rooms, many objects, and many enemies. If the walls were occluders and all the objects/enemies occludees, then you would only be rendering what you can immediately see. So instead of rendering dozens of rooms and hundreds of items, you are rendering at most one room’s worth of content at a time and maybe a hallway or
