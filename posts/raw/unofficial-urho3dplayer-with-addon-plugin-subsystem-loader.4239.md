Hello every one,

I am new in this forum and sorry for my poor English. I create my own Urho player because the engine itself haven't the plugin loader and I don't know why.

Here is the link: [https://github.com/zazouza23/Unofficial-Urho3DPlayer](https://github.com/zazouza23/Unofficial-Urho3DPlayer) To try if you want.
but noted that I only tested on the windows platform. In theory, it should work on other platforms like mac or linux, but I'm not sure.

If you have any problem with, give me the info and I will try my best to solve it.

Thanks you all :)
