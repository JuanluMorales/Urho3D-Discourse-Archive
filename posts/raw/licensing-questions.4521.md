Regarding code, Urho is liberally licensed so you are safe selling any software you do with it.

Regarding assets, you have to own any right to them or be legally entitled to use them if you want to be safe; this is valid for any engine and any game and is not related to Urho in particular.

Using Urho3D does _not_ affect any rights you may have over your assets.
Technically you can even sell the engine itself legally, without building game around it.
