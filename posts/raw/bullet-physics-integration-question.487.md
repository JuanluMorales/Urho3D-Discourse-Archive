Are there any plans to support more of the Bullet Physics API as part of the base engine, such as 6dof spring constraints, gears, etc ?
I was thinking of adding it in, but didn't want to ... reinvent the wheel ...  :smiley:

There is no ongoing work for that. Pull requests to implement eg. more constraints are welcome.
