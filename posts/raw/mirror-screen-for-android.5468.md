I came across this repo
https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy

And verified to work on Android 4.2+ but failed on Android 4.1.2. Let me add that it is expected to fail on Android 4.1.2 device and lower due to not having support for local copy function. Other than that, it is amazing how fast it is -- latency seems much lower than if you were streaming from PC to PC using localhost.
