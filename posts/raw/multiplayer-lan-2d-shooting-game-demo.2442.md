We have made a multiplayer(LAN) 2d-shooting game demo called [i]AirFighter[/i] based on Urho3D. 

We provide detailed introduction to this project. And the program annotation is also detailed.

AirFighter is a relatively complete demo with character control system, shooting system, networking system, BUFF system and skill system although we have only few instances of them.

And there are still lots of bugs in network system. Your help to fix them will be appreciated.

This is our github repository url : [github.com/micromiss/Urho3D-Demo-AirFighter](https://github.com/micromiss/Urho3D-Demo-AirFighter)
