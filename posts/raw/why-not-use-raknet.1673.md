Some month ago, i read the code of knet. And i found it not so good. so many memory copy while send and receive packet.
Now raknet have become open source, I read the code of raknet, it's far better than knet.
why not use raknet?

Lasse and Urho Core Team sort of approved of it, just need someone to make it all happen.
