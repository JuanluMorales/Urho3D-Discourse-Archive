As I understand it, the call to “Node.Remove()” should instruct the parent of the node to erase itself as children and in doing so may call the node’s destructor (if the refcount reaches 0) which in turn destroy all the node’s children and components automatically. In other words, there is no need for you to clean up the node yourself in the Terminate() function. Assuming you don’t have have other AngelScript node handle that references the same object, once this remaining node handle used in the Terminate() function goes out of scope then the object will be guaranteed to be destroyed along with its children and components. I am not sure why your code work when runs normally but not when stepping through the code in Debug mode without looking more closely to the rest of your code though, but your guess is as good as anyone of us. Probably the node’s children/components has been deleted when you stepping through the code that still try to use them.

I would guess this has to do with how the ScriptInstance::HandleSceneUpdate(StringHash eventType, VariantMap\u0026amp; eventData) is organized – the script’s Update(float) angelscript call occurs right at the end of the HandleSceneUpdate method, so there is nothing to cause a SigSegV if the node (and by extension the script component) is deleted, while because of the for loop around the delayedExecute checks and the later stuff in that method, if the script is deleted in a delayed call, you can end up with one (or at least with some problems). Interestingly, something, perhaps in how the angelscript is implemented, keeps it from crashing even with the delayedExecute that removes the node, though at that point it does spew forth lots of \"Exception ‘Null pointer access’ in ‘void Battlemon::FixedUpdate(float)’    AngelScript callstack: … \" errors and the node does not actually seem to be removed. While it didn’t crash with me this time from this, it did crash when I later attempted to create an object from that node (but that may be related to having stored a LogicComponent derivative in a SharedPtr, which only stores the node in a regular pointer). Regardless of that, the ‘Null pointer access’ error is quite annoying on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, its easy to work around – either a boolean set by the delayed execute that causes it to be removed, a simple counter in the Update(float) method that then removes it, or attaching it to another node that removes it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, though, I don’t think I’ve seen any problems with the angelscript reference counting – I think all of that has worked fine (I just wasn’t certain how I needed to remove nodes and their components).
