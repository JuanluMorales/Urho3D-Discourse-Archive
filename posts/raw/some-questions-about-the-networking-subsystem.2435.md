Hi!

I really can't understand the networking system in Urho3D.  What does 'scene replication' really mean? I found that the code just executed in the server will also execute in the clients. In my project, each player(as a client) controls a fighter which can launcher a missile when he push the key Q. The missile will track anyone who in its tracking range except the launcher. Yet the missile will not run the same in the server and clients. It seems that the 'missile' component just ran independently in the server and clients. Sometimes the missile boomed in the server but didn't boomed in the client. Somethings the missile launched in by the client's fighter will track the launcher itself (It never happened in singleplayer game.). So I really want to know that how to understand the network subsystem in Urho3D especially the truly meaning of 'scene replication'.

THANKS!

Surely I have read this but it doesn't explain how the 'scene replication' works.

Definitely it explains.
Scene replication is when your clients see the same state of replicated nodes as server has.
You also mustn't do anything with replicated nodes on client side.
If you need extra explanation, ask more specific questions.

Thanks for your help and I'll check the tutorials and codes more carefully then.
