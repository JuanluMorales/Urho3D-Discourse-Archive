Hi what is the current method of accessing the gallery on IOS and Android? For example if I want to write and read an image from the gallery. Does the app need special permissions for writing?

I think the Gallery is a public folder in Android (I haven't checked).  If so, then you can access it similar to [url]http://discourse.urho3d.io/t/android-acquiring-externalstoragepublicpath/1365/1[/url] but using Gallery instead of MyGame.
