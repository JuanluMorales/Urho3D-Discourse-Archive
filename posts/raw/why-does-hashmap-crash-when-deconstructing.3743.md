Im trying to create a new subsystem:

    class Keybinds: public Object
    {
        URHO3D_OBJECT(Keybinds, Object)

    //...

    private:
        HashMap<StringHash, Vector<int>> m_keybinds;
        HashMap<StringHash, bool> m_actionPressed;
    }

and register it with 

    context_->RegisterSubsystem(new Keybinds(context_));

in the Start() function of the application

but when i call

    engine_->Exit();

to close the application then the application crashes in the destructor of the HashMaps i defined in the SubSystem:

    ~HashMap()
    {
        Clear();
        FreeNode(Tail());
        AllocatorUninitialize(allocator_);
        delete[] ptrs_; // <-- Here !
    }

i tried multiple things but i dont know what is happening!
Can someone help me out?

compiled with Visual Studio 2017, Debug x64  Urho3D Shared

After the application crahses i get this message:

    HEAP[Minecraft Clone.exe]: Invalid address specified to RtlValidateHeap( 000002796A5C0000, 00000279714FE140 )
    Minecraft Clone.exe hat einen Haltepunkt ausgelÃ¶st.

EDIT: Wow i tried to run it in the Release build and it seems that it doenst crash anmyore, so why does it happen only in the debug build ?!

Do you use Static MSVC Runtime?

-------------------------

Debug: Multithreaded-Debug-DLL
Release: Multithreaded-DLL

i changed it to Multithreaded-Debug and it fixed it but is there a reason you need a static runtime?

EDIT: i dont know what is happening it seems to allways change. i like switched back and forth with the configurations and then completely rebuild the whole project but now it doenst work anymore on any debug runtime. I created a console with

	AllocConsole();
	#pragma warning(disable:4996)
	freopen("CONOUT$", "w", stdout);

and when switching the configurations sometimes the log (the log you would find in the log file) will appear in the console and sometimes not.

The simplest way is to just link Urho statically (I mean Urho library, regardless of runtime). I'm 99% sure it will work perfectly.

Ok turns out i cant use the Release build of urho3d for my debug application its works perfectly now!
