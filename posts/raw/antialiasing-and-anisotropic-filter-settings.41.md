Hi.
I see the Vsync, multisampling and other setting but no the Antialiasing(same as multisampling?) and Anisotropic filter settings?

Anisotropic filtering is set on the renderer. (Have to check the docs for the command cant remember it off the top of my head).
AA is Multi-sampling (MSAA) but only works in Forward Rendering.
