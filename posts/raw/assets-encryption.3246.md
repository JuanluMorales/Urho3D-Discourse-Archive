Is any urho-binded tool to proguard assets?

In order to encrypt something the program/client must have a way to decrypt it back. Otherwise encryption would be another synonym for deletion. And because the client must be able to decrypt/access the assets. It would be the same as delivering a safe along with it's manual and the combination/code to whomever you're trying to protect your things from. Again, what's the point?

So now that encryption is out of the way. Let's talk proprietary file formats. Basically, making your own formats and hoping the client isn't persistent enough and doesn't have enough knowledge to reverse engineer your stuff. 

Nobody encrypts assets. Because there's no point. And also you can't. At least not if you want the client to be able to use them.

There are times when assets must be protected, see topic:
