The point was to get a general understanding of how “Procedural Generation” could work, my project went through a fairly simple process for generating a star system:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003eSingle Star, or Binary?\nIf Single, determine mass, classification, and temperature.\nIf Binary Determine Aphelion and Perihelion, then mass, classifications, and temperatures.\nHave Barycentre get and sum masses of central star(s).\nDetermine amount of planets and planets with satellites (moons).\nOn generation of each individual planet check if in Goldilocks zone, run random range for if intelligent life.\nIf intelligent life = true, generate colony, determine life form technological advancement.\nIf technological advancement = true, generate a minimum of one \"man made\" satellite orbiting barycentre.\nOn generation of each individual planet outside determine classification of planet (from \"Hot gas Giant\" to \"cold rock\" and everything in between).\nDetermine resource types and amount available per planet.\nAfter planet generation, determine if asteroid belt = true, if true generate asteroid belt (each asteroid was it's own \"gameobject\") determine aphelion and perihelion of asteroid belt.\nGenerate \"Alien structure\" as farthest orbiting body of star system. Alien Structure was the only means of transport from star system to star system. Has ability to transport whole fleets of space ships.\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t get too far into actual game play as the point was to determine a proper pipeline for system generation. After that was achieved I set my sights on a more toned back version of the generator within a 3D environment mostly not accounting for actual orbit because it doesn’t make sense gameplay wise when orbiting bodies appear to be standing still to the human eye. There is still a lot of work to do on the pipeline like understanding the use of perlin noise to create textures on runtime. As well as other graphical additions that I did not account for in the 2D version. I also need to gain a grasp of XML as a means to properly save/load generated star systems. To me XML is really exciting as it can give me saved data per system generated to help improve the pipeline. \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=5\" title=\":smiley:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":smiley:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment I’ve thought of a method for “Large object LOD” this would be for objects greater than X Km’s long like Planets and Super structures. It involves transitioning from a scene with small objects to a scene with a bigger more detailed objects the closer you get to the object in question. (Detailed objects would always be at 0,0,0 of the scene transition) It’s going to be difficult to implement as my understanding of C++ syntax is weak. However I think I’m up for the task. (I’m not going to attempt planetary landing, procedural generation of that level is too high of a scope, just being able to get close to a planet and it looking massive on screen is the goal) I hope to use world tiling for believable distances for the smaller/less detailed planet objects and super structures giving the illusion that the player has just traveled a great distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003caside class=\"quote\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n hd_:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first guess was floating precision error.
