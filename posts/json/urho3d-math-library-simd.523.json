You will only get significant gains if you have massive arrays of data that are piece-meal’d in small structure of arrays in a tight loop that fits in CPU cache and you need to do some math logic on it (the blendshape blending comes to mind, or if you want to do CPU skinning or a cloth sim, stuff like that would be the easiest to apply SIMD onto).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother suggestion is to use intel’s ISPC for these tasks, which could run on Urho worker threads as well.

The point about flexibility vs. performance vs. ease-of-use is quite critical; lately I’ve seen some engine API’s that go really far to support a data-oriented approach, but in doing so they actually present a quite “hostile” API to the user, for example you may not be free to reconfigure a scene sub-graph (reparenting nodes) after creating it, in the interest of maximum performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will probably examine at some point, when Urho’s render refactoring is in good shape, whether Turso3D can be modified to become a godlike data-oriented engine which still remains friendly for use.
