Hi guys,
I have a weird issues on Android hard to track it down. I have a TouchMove event and I am setting the position of a sphere using ScreenToWorldPoint. On desktop everything works perfectly when I click the mouse and move it the sphere is exactly where the cursor is. On Android when I move around the sphere is behind my finger if I stop somewhere it will catch up it looks like it is delayed but my FPS is constant of 60 without any drops.

Any ideas? This happens only on the device the emulator seems fine.
