In Source there’s Client, Server, and Urho folders that have the respective sources, and then I use CMake to generate the project files in Builds/platform/Client||Server||Urho and compile from there, building urho first so that I can specify URHO3D_HOME when I CMake the client and server projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo yeah, that’s the structure of how I do things now. Can anyone point me in the right direction as to how I put together a “clean” release client for distribution? Thanks!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEDIT: I’ve tried some simple things like just taking the Client folder out of builds but that breaks everything, and isn’t what I’m going for since that still has all the visual studio project files in it and stuff\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2020-07-10T21:53:10.128Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":4,"reads":25,"readers_count":24,"score":25.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":6254,"topic_slug":"project-cmake-help","display_username":"Ka-Wiz","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":827,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":38268,"name":"Ka-Wiz","username":"Ka-Wiz","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/k/cdc98d/{size}.png","created_at":"2020-07-11T02:45:09.301Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eOkay, after messing around with it a bit I think I can clarify this question:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe client is setup as a downstream project as per “Using Urho3D Library” documentation.
