Hi! 

A month ago I, my wife and my brother decided to participate in [itch.io](http://itch.io/) Game Off 2017 jam, so we thought about ideas and came up with something like this. - [https://miegamicis.itch.io/wild-dimension](https://miegamicis.itch.io/wild-dimension) This was a great opportunity for us to learn something new and create something playable in strict time frame (1 month). I took a role as a programmer and my goal was to learn AngelScript language and Urho3D engine in general, if someone is interested, the game code is open sourced so you can grab the latest code here https://github.com/ArnisLielturks/Urho3D
A lot of aspects of the game is still unpolished but maybe someone could find this useful. Everything is built on top of Urho3DPlayer sample and all the game related logic is written using AngelScript. Build steps are the same as they are for the Urho3D engine. I haven't tested the Android build in a while, but I'm pretty sure it still works, except some of the game controls may not work.

This looks like a lot of content for a month-long project, congratulations! I'll try it out when I get the chance.
