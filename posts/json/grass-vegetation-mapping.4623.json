The mesh draws vegetation info from a texture overlaid on the terrain, which describes how to draw/place it. The technique phases in the vegetation at a certain radius, by increasing a scale factor from 0 to keep things from visibly popping into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, I have been able to implement it fairly well in Urho3D.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"//cdck-file-uploads-global.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/standard17/uploads/urho3d/original/2X/c/cb3fbf10a0be7b6a7d75d969859db63d56ed9ce0.jpeg\" alt\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(I’m using a very quickly made experimental mesh, so it doesn’t look the greatest yet; just trying to figure the technique out before I spend a bunch of time refining it.)I do have a couple issues, though, that I’m unable to sort out:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the mesh is being deformed in the vertex shader using a vertex texture fetch from the heightmap, the actual geometry is clipped from view if, for example, the player is on a high hill, since the ‘real’ bounding box of the grass structure still sits at Y=0 and is not very tall. I can hack my way around this by adding a small bit of degenerate geometry to the grass mesh, placing it at some arbitrary high point (Y=300 works well) above the rest of the mesh to artificially inflate the height of the mesh bounding box, but I was wondering if there was a less hackish way of ensuring the grass mesh is drawn even if the ‘real’ bounding box is out of frustum. Is there some way to mark a model as “do not cull for any reason” or something like that? I don’t like having to blow up the size of the bounding box, since that can play hell with shadow mapping when looking out horizontally on the terrain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI created a GrassShadow.glsl shader to implement a VS for the shadow pass, that implements the same texture fetch and translation as the main shader, but it doesn’t seem to work. If I use the default Shadow.glsl I get shadows as if the grass were always at the Y=0 plane, but the shadows do not ‘follow’ the grass as it translates upward due to the heightmap. However, if I use a modification of Shadow.glsl that includes the texture fetch and translation, I get no shadows at all, even at Y=0, which makes me wonder if the Shadow shader isn’t getting all of the uniforms I’m sending the main shader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan anybody confirm whether or not the shadow pass gets the same set of uniforms as the main shader? I am setting the HeightData uniform, the HeightMap texture and the CoverMap texture manually through code after the material is loaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main shader can be seen at \u003ca href=\"https://pastebin.com/NdRufTKZ\" class=\"inline-onebox-loading\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttps://pastebin.com/NdRufTKZ\u003c/a\u003e while the shadow shader can be seen at \u003ca href=\"https://pastebin.com/DLKV4ThW\" class=\"inline-onebox-loading\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttps://pastebin.com/DLKV4ThW\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am passing 2 textures (the heightmap and the foliage coverage map) as well as a vec4 uniform that contains the heightmap dimensions and the terrain sampling sizes (x/z sample spacing and height) that are passed to Terrain::SetSpacing. The shader uses the sampling parameters and size to calculate texture coordinates, then indexes the heightmap texture to calculate a vertical translation that is applied to the vertex. The coverage map currently encodes X and Z offsets in the R and B channels, to translate the billboard geometry by a small amount to help alleviate the rigid grid-like structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit: I have uploaded a repo demonstrating the issue: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/JTippetts/Urho3DGrassTest\" class=\"inline-onebox-loading\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehttps://github.com/JTippetts/Urho3DGrassTest\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2018-10-29T15:47:12.802Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":23,"reads":52,"readers_count":51,"score":160.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":4623,"topic_slug":"grass-vegetation-mapping","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":3,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=23354","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"Frontier Rebooted Part 7: What Have We Learned Today? - Twenty Sided","clicks":8},{"url":"https://github.com/JTippetts/Urho3DGrassTest","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"GitHub - JTippetts/Urho3DGrassTest: Testing dynamic grass in Urho3D","clicks":4},{"url":"https://pastebin.com/NdRufTKZ","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"[C++] #include \"Uniforms.glsl\" #include \"Samplers.glsl\" #include \"Transform.glsl\" # - Pastebin.com","clicks":1},{"url":"https://pastebin.com/DLKV4ThW","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"[C++] #include \"Uniforms.glsl\" #include \"Samplers.glsl\" #include \"Transform.glsl\" - Pastebin.com","clicks":0},{"url":"https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/render-grass-blades-on-specific-part-of-terrain-texture/5304/5","internal":true,"reflection":true,"title":"Render grass blades on specific part of terrain texture?","clicks":0}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":2}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":30,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":26369,"name":"Jonathan","username":"Sinoid","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/f19dbf/{size}.png","created_at":"2018-10-29T02:09:27.875Z","cooked":"\u003caside class=\"quote no-group\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"4623\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"title\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"quote-controls\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cimg alt width=\"20\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://sjc6.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/jtippetts/40/357_1.png\" class=\"avatar\"\u003e JTippetts:\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan anybody confirm whether or not the shadow pass gets the same set of uniforms as the main shader?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.
