I ran into this article on GamingOnLinux:

https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/valve-to-open-source-gamenetworkingsockets-to-help-developers-with-networking-steam-not-required.11483

Here's the repository:

Could this be interesting as a default network solution for Urho3D?

err, so just their Reliable UDP implementation?
That's something Urho (and pretty much any other major game engine) has.

RakNet actually offers useful features that Urho doesn't have.
