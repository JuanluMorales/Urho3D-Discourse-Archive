I’m just curious how u3d is able to run so much smoother and faster than other engines/applications/games.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe more I use it the more I understand it. And the more I understand it the more I like it. It just works. I don’t know much about low-level graphics rendering and all that. I know just know some of the basics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m getting a new laptop tomorrow (with a discrete gpu). Long story short I’ve been on a bottom-of-the-barrel laptop for the last 3 years (good one broke) with only integrated graphics. However, the silver lining is being forced to learn efficiency. I’m continually impressed with just how much I can do with urho that I can’t even dream of otherwise. I can hardly load a unity sample at all whereas I can make a 3d urho game and 1000 trees doesn’t put a dent in my 60fps, on top of a huge terrain, navmesh, bloom and npcs. I can’t play regular 3d games but I can make them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s going on here? Is there a benchmark of 3d engines that explains this? Or is it just that scenes in urho are initially and inherently lightweight? Or are the majority of games/engines just being lazy because the hardware can take it? Or is it because urho uses .mdl binary models? This is really interesting to me, and I’m sure I would have overlooked/not noticed urho’s speed if I had a better computer.

The more things the engine performs, the slower it works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrho has very simple default shaders, Unity has much more complicated default shaders.\u003cbr\u003e\nUrho has rough navigation over simplified navmesh, Unity supports height mesh for precise positioning.\u003cbr\u003e\nIf I remember things right, Urho has default PCF shadow quality 2x2, Unity has default PCF quality 5x5.

There’s plenty of older, objectively good games without the new, almost gimmicky, graphics. It’s been years since I’ve actually played a game like I used to. The most I’ll do is retro multiplayer with my brothers, which is more of a social event than a video game hobby (playing C\u0026amp;C and Halo 2). I’m just not interested in the new things coming out, which I’m not sure is an age thing or just that I prefer the older games/nostalgia. Maybe a little of both.

Urho’s editor looks really easy to use but I just feel more comfortable scripting everything, even if it doesn’t really make sense to. I just use a text editor (geany) and set a keyboard macro to run the current project as is (no compiling). The nice thing about a more minimal engine is using only what you need.
