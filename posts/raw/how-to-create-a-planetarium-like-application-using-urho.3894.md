Hello,

I am just collecting information about how to create a **planetarium** like application using **Urho**.
For example an application, like [Stellarium](http://stellarium.org/).
What I think I need definitely is a sphere (Earth) in the center of the world (Universe) where the camera (observer, telescope) will be somewhere on the surface of that sphere (Earth).
Stars (or other objects, like clusters, galaxies, nebulaes) on the sky can be also small spheres, where visibility and position is calculated based on real star catalogue information ([Simbad](http://cdsportal.u-strasbg.fr/), [NED](http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/forms/byname.html)).

Any help, information or link to similar project **implemented using Urho** is appreciated!

Best Regards,

Ladislav
