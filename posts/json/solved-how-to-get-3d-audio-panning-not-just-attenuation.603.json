As I move the camera/listener away I get the desired attenuation. However, if I pass by the sound source on either side then I can‚Äôt actually tell which side the audio is coming from. NinjaSnowWar achieves more by playing a sound from left or right depending where it is in the scene, and you can hear roughly where explosions happen because of it, but I‚Äôm working in .cpp not .as so it‚Äôs more difficult for me to learn from that example. Suggestions? It‚Äôs as if you‚Äôre wearing headphones listening to the sound and you turn the volume up or down depending how close you are to the sound source, so you can‚Äôt tell which side of you it may be on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003e// Snippet from where the listener is created\n\t SoundListener* listener = cameraNode_-\u0026gt;CreateComponent\u0026lt;SoundListener\u0026gt;();\n\t GetSubsystem\u0026lt;Audio\u0026gt;()-\u0026gt;SetListener(listener);\n\n// Snippet from where the audio begins playing\n\tSound* effect = cache-\u0026gt;GetResource\u0026lt;Sound\u0026gt;(\"Sounds/effect.ogg\");\n\tNode* effectNode = boxNode-\u0026gt;CreateChild(\"soundEffect\");\n\tSoundSource3D* source = effectNode-\u0026gt;CreateComponent\u0026lt;SoundSource3D\u0026gt;();\n\tsource-\u0026gt;SetSoundType(SOUND_EFFECT);\n\tsource-\u0026gt;Play(effect);\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdit\u003cbr\u003e\nlistener is parented to the cameraNode, and\u003cbr\u003e\nsource is parented to the node in the scene I walk around (boxNode).\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:01:37.258Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":8,"reads":6,"readers_count":5,"score":41.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":603,"topic_slug":"solved-how-to-get-3d-audio-panning-not-just-attenuation","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":41,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":3322,"name":"","username":"GGibson","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/g/fbc32d/{size}.png","created_at":"2014-12-01T00:52:32.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eSo silly me I was thinking Urho would handle a stereo file just fine in spatialization, but no.
