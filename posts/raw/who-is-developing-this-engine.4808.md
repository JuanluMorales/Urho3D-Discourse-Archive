My name is Leith Ketchell.
I hold a bachelor degree, specializing in game development, but prior to that,

I was an engine developer, and I still am. Who is running this show? I'd love to have a chat about tech.

I mean the person who (to my knowledge) started this doesn't work on Urho anymore. It's more of a community project now. I'd give you their name, but I totally forgot it. Sure they'll come here and talk to you about the project though.They are still fairly active here as far as I'm aware..

Most of [the work](https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/graphs/contributors) (founding included) was done by @cadaver, but he [left](https://discourse.urho3d.io/t/stepping-down-from-urho-lead-dev-role/3478) the project and took on a sporadic advisory role.
@weitjong currently seems like the most consistent factor in the development team, but he's mainly concerned with Urho's build system. Although he has not accepted the position of "leader" I do think he's one of the people to approach concerning core dev team management. I see him as Urho's main guardian or gatekeeper in the current situation.

Thank you for your replies.
I would like to donate some time to core development.

I'm slowly digesting this beast, and see a number of areas that could be improved - especially, there are some major holes in the docs! Where do I find a prioritized TODO list, that I might offer some assistance in terms of engine code?
