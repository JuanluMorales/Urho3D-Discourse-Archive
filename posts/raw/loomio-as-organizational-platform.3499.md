With @cadaver stepping down and the introduction of a new coding standard, now may be a good moment to give something like [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/g/pxUAWwg2/urho3d) a try.

It's just a [suggestion](https://www.loomio.org/d/POLoGAwR/switching-to-loomio-for-making-decisions-), but it may prove fruitful. Naturally for it to help in reaching consensus most (core) devs would need to join.

Approved, now you can invite/accept others too.

The Diaspora* team reflected on using Loomio for nearly 5 years in [this post](https://www.loomio.org/d/Agop3EXq/outgrowing-loomio).

Actually Discourse has a pretty neat set of polling features:
[poll type=regular max=1 public=true]
* Proper use of Discourse polling functionality and threads should be sufficient.
* Loomio seems to provide something extra.
[/poll]

[poll name=poll2 type=multiple min=2 max=4]
* Sometimes
* you want to
* allow people
* to pick more
* options
[/poll]

A split in communication channels is not a small thing and Loomio does seem to have been heading in a more commercial direction.
