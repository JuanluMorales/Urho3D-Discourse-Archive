Hi, I'm currently working on online game. I frequently have to change some nodes from local to replicated and vice versa. 
From editor, I usually do this, "save node as" -> "load node as local/replicated". But I think this way is impractical and generate some unneeded files. 

Is there any simpler way to change node's createMode from editor?

Thanks.

I decided to create converter on Hierarchy Window.

Maybe I'll make pull request if that's okay.  :laughing:
