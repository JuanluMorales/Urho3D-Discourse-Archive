Hi, all!

Have anybody done radial menu in Urho? I'd like to grab an example of widget.
The ones I talk are in Yandere Simulator game and House Party game
It is circle built of sectors. Each sector of the circle is manu option.
One cas select needed option by either pressing designated keys or
a mouse click.

I created a radial gui template in UIMesh - the last blue dial in the gif.
