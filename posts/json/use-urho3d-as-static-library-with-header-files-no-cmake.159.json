So I compiled the latest commit (because there are the 2Dphysics implemented). In forehand I tried to use a static build, but it had no 2D physics support. But now with the self-compiled version I m asking myself what are the right headers? I can’t use the old from v1.31 and I can’t see a pattern in the headers so I just copy from the latest commit(in the commit: everything in subdirectories; in the precompiled release: just header files in the main directory and some directories for the 3rd party headers).

In the source package, we include all the header files that are required to build the Urho3D library. While in the binary package, we only include the header files that are required by the Urho3D library user in their own project. That is, the latter does not include all the headers from the third party libraries, it only includes selected few that are directly being referenced by Urho3D own header files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can get the latest bleeding edge of Urho3D library and header files in two ways:\u003cbr\u003e\n[ol]\u003cbr\u003e\n[li] Get the latest source code from GitHub and build it. You can leave the build artifact in the Urho3D project root tree or install it. The ‘install’ built-in target will install the Urho3D library and the required header files into a your local file system. The FindUrho3D CMake module should be able to find them in both cases (in project root tree or in installed location).[/li]\u003cbr\u003e\n[li] Get the latest snapshot binary package for your target platform. It only contains the library and the required header files (as if they are being installed from ‘install’ built-in target).[/li][/ol]\u003cbr\u003e\nSince you are not using CMake, I suppose the second way is more suitable for you. You should be able to find the correct header files in the ‘include’ sub-dir after unzipping the package. I also strongly advice you to have a closer look on the Urho3D.pc file located in the ‘lib/pkgconfig’ sub-dir, although you are not using pkg-config tool. Below is some content snippet of that file for a 64-bit SHARED lib type. Note that the compiler defines are slightly different between using Urho3D STATIC and Urho3D SHARED lib type. For example, the Urho3D STATIC lib type always require -DURHO3D_STATIC_DEFINE being defined in order to build successfully. Also, note that the compiler flags set in Urho3D.pc in the Windows snapshot binary package found in SourceForge are meant for MinGW compiler (You can get a Urho3D.pc for MSVC if you can get someone with CMake and MSVC build the binary package for you).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[code]Libs:    -L${libdir} -lUrho3D -luser32 -lgdi32 -lwinmm -limm32 -lole32 -loleaut32 -lversion -luuid -lws2_32 -lwinmm -lopengl32\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCflags:  -DENABLE_SSE -DENABLE_FILEWATCHER -DENABLE_PROFILING -DENABLE_LOGGING -DUSE_OPENGL -DENABLE_ANGELSCRIPT -DENABLE_LUA  -Wno-invalid-offsetof -ffast-math -m64 -static -static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc  -I${includedir} -I${includedir}/Bullet -I${includedir}/kNet -I${includedir}/SDL -I${includedir}/AngelScript[/code]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorry for the long post.
