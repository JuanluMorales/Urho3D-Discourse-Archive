I just read the news that RPI 3 is available for sale since last weekend. From the specs it appears that the CPU got a major improvement from RPI 2, however, it still comes with the same old GPU. What get me excited about is the 64-bit readiness of the CPU. Once we have an OS that could boot it into 64-bit (i.e. when we have a 64-bit sysroot), it will be a piece of cake to support building 64-bit Urho3D for RPI with our current build system. And if I ever receive a donation of RPI 3 device as incentive, I can promise that to happen sooner  :wink:.
