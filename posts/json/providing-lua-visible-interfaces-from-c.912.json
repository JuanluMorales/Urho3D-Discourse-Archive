I’m attempting to build a game that’s implemented in a mixture of Lua and C++. Unsurprisingly, my intent is to implement the coarse-grained game logic in Lua, with performance-critical bits in C++. So far, I’ve had not trouble implementing custom Drawable components in C++ (kudos to the team for making bootstrapping a C++ project far easier than I’m accustomed to!), but I’ve hit a bit of a snag in the Lua integration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalling simple Lua scripts is easy enough. Where I’m having trouble is in exposing interfaces to my custom components to script code. I believe I understand the structure and logic used for the built-in classes – as I understand it, there’s a .pkg definition file for each exposed interface, run through tolua++ to generate, e.g., NodeLuaAPI.cpp, which appears to include all the necessary Lua binding logic. So far, so good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, when I attempt to do the same for my own custom classes, I hit build issues at every turn, giving me the impression I’m fundamentally misunderstanding something. The package definitions seem straightforward enough. But the compiled output (via ToCppHook.lua) \u003cspan class=\"hashtag\"\u003e#includes\u003c/span\u003e \u0026lt;tolua++.h\u0026gt;, “lua.h”, and “LuaScript/ToLuaUtils.h”. These references appear to assume that they’ll be running within the Urho3D source build, not external projects (e.g., otherwise, I’d expect to see \u003cspan class=\"hashtag\"\u003e#include\u003c/span\u003e “Urho3D/LuaScript/ToLuaUtils.h”).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy next step was to hope that ToCppHook.lua was not actually necessary (it might be the case that the stuff for PODVector, et al, in there is only needed for the library itself), so I dropped the {-L […]/ToCppHook.lua from my tolua++ invocation. If I also add Source/ThirdParty/Lua/src to my include path, then manually call {tolua_MyThing_open(luaScript-\u0026gt;GetState());} during startup, then (yay!) it actually works, and I can call {node:CreateComponent(“MyThing”)} without it crashing in the lua binding code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy question is this – am I swimming upstream on this approach, and/or is there a simpler way to achieve my goals? I feel like my build’s more than a little precarious, reaching around into the Urho3D source tree for include paths for lua.h, and I have the sneaking suspicion that dropping ToCppHook.lua from the tolua++ invocation is causing problems I haven’t hit yet. Any guidance or pointers would be greatly appreciated. And if it happens that this is a legitimate-but-not-well-supported use-case, I’m glad to lend a hand in supporting it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks in advance,\u003cbr\u003e\njoel.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:04:03.551Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":18,"reads":13,"readers_count":12,"score":92.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":912,"topic_slug":"providing-lua-visible-interfaces-from-c","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":215,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":5266,"name":"Yao Wei Tjong","username":"weitjong","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/weitjong/{size}/4_2.png","created_at":"2015-03-09T06:00:13.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eIn regard to ‘add Source/ThirdParty/Lua/src’ to include path - It is not clear whether you are using the Urho3D 1.32 release or the Urho3D master branch. If it is the latter and if you have used the provided FindUrho3D CMake module in your external project then the problem can be fixed by enabling the URHO3D_LUA build option when you configure/generate your external project files. The latest master branch has a commit which “install” the Lua/LuaJIT and tolua++ header files and let the FindUrho3D module to add the Lua include dir into the include search path for external project.

Alternatively, for a quicker fix, you can just customize this hook to suit your own project need and invoke tolua++ tool with your custom version.
