Welcome to the Forum!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have downloaded the sourcecode for Urho3D - for the sake of clarity, lets call that the “master” folder. The master sourcecode is meant to be “platform agnostic” - it’s a blueprint that we can “unroll” for a specific target machine and compiler… It’s going to help us to create a project that targets our chosen compiler, so we can build urho3D using our compiler and target platform of choice.\u003cbr\u003e\nOne way to proceed is to use CMAKE to generate a “build folder” from your “master” - this is essentially a C++ Project for a compiler of your choice. You said “exe” - can I assume you’re using Windows? Do you have Visual Studio installed? Choose it in CMAKE as your target compiler.\u003cbr\u003e\nOnce you have generated a “build folder”, finally, you can build the Urho3D Project (in the build folder), which will generate a folder called “bin” (in the build folder), which contains your Executables. It will also create a folder called “lib”, which contains the lib file for use in your own projects, assuming you choose not to use the “player app” (see bin folder).\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2019-05-17T13:13:55.527Z","reply_count":1,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":30,"readers_count":29,"score":11.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":5156,"topic_slug":"exe-file-is-not-there-in-the-downloaded-file","display_username":"Leith Ketchell","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":"suspended user","title_is_group":false,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1098,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"user_suspended":true,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":29743,"name":"gvnarendra","username":"gvnarendra","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/g/8c91f0/{size}.png","created_at":"2019-05-17T13:32:37.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eOk thank you\u003cbr\u003e\nI will try the method.

I think helping users understand how to build the library (teaching to fish) is very useful, as users will have to build their game, which is generally a similar experience. I think a fairer analogy (unless you only intend to use scripts for your game) is that you can make a cake (your game) from a packaged mix and other ingredients, or you can skip the packaged mix and make that part as well (build Urho as well). The skills and tools needed between the two aren’t very different, it’s just a little more tedious to make your own mix (build Urho) than to get it prepackaged one, but you have more flexibility in what goes into it (e.g. disable unused engine components).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs to the builds, I think you only need 1 computer if you have a Mac.
