Hello comunity !!!

Is there a program/tool to help in the creation of a realistic human rigged 3d Model? I also need the animations, or in a failure of this first question a good website with this kind of resources? Thank you in advance !!

For the human. Perhaps the most generic answer [makehuman](http://www.makehumancommunity.org/).
For the animation. Perhaps the most generic answer (again) [mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/).

And that's where your story ends. Unless you have that $$$ to **waste**. You didn't mention whether it'd be free or not, so. It's always that trade-off between time to do it your self or money to make someone else do it. Either by direct or indirect means.

Thank you @S.L.C !!!
I already know makehuman, but i dont know how to put the models clothes, mixamo i didnt knew it i will try it, yep i have some money to waste, as long as the model has all those requirements already and good quality. Thank you !!

Mixamo is a great place to start! The auto-rigger is not too bad if your character is a biped in a T pose. Being able to upload your own (rigged, or not) models is nice too.

As an artist I hurl at the sight of Maximo rigs. It's the Google Sketchup of character animation.

As a non artist, its one of the few lifelines that i can use to attract artists to my cause, royalty free
