Recently I added some lua code that removes nodes whose “health” value has hit 0. This crashed the engine (as in segfault) in some other lua code which had stored the node in a table. I would expect the entries to be either nil’d out or have some sort of “invalid” marker that could be checked, but I haven’t discovered anything that might work like that. It appears from the C++ code that the node is being deleted (when node:Remove() is called) even though Lua still has pointers to it (hence the segfault later on). Could this be fixed by using sharedptrs for lua references? If not, how can I store nodes in a table safely?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere’s a short standalone script illustrating the problem (you can run it with Urho3DPlayer in headless mode):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003e\nlocal total = 0\nlocal lastPrintTime = 0\nlocal invalidNodes = {}\n\nfunction Start()\n\tscene_ = Scene()\n\n\t-- Create scene subsystem components\n\tscene_:CreateComponent(\"Octree\", LOCAL)\n\tlocal phys = scene_:CreateComponent(\"PhysicsWorld\", LOCAL)\n\tphys.gravity = Vector3(0,-9.8,0)\n\n\tSubscribeToEvent(\"Update\", \"UpdateStuff\")\n\nend\n\nLifeTimer = ScriptObject()\n\nfunction UpdateStuff()\n\n\tlocal dt = 0.02\n\n\t-- Make sure there are 10 alive objects\n\twhile total \u0026lt; 10 do\n\t\tprint(\"Creating\")\n\t\tlocal newNode = scene_:CreateChild()\n\t\tnewNode:CreateScriptObject(\"LifeTimer\")\n\t\ttotal = total + 1\n\t\tprint(\"Created\")\n\tend\n\n\t-- Print out the table every so often\n\tlastPrintTime = lastPrintTime + dt\n\tif lastPrintTime \u0026gt; 1 then\n\n\t\tfor i,n in ipairs(invalidNodes) do\n\t\t\t-- Problems occur on the next two lines\n\t\t\tprint(\"\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Test:\",n.ID,n.position.x)\n\t\t\tn:SendEvent(\"Junk\")\n\t\tend\n\n\t\tprint(\"Done test\")\n\n\t\tlastPrintTime = lastPrintTime-1\n\tend\n\nend\n\n\nfunction LifeTimer:Start()\n\tself.life = 1.5\n\tself.node.position = Vector3(Random(-10,10),Random(-10,10),Random(-10,10))\n\tprint(\"Start\")\nend\n\nfunction LifeTimer:Stop()\n\tprint(\"Stop\")\nend\n\nfunction LifeTimer:FixedUpdate(dt)\n\tself.life = self.life - dt\n\tif self.life \u0026lt;= 0 then\n\n\t\tprint(\"Removing\")\n\n\t\t-- Add to table before removing\n\t\ttable.insert(invalidNodes, self.node)\n\t\t-- Remove the node\n\t\tself.node:Remove()\n\n\t\tprint(\"Removed\")\n\t\ttotal = total - 1\n\tend\nend\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might not crash for a while (or it might give Lua errors instead), but Valgrind will show you the problems.\u003cbr\u003e\nI’m using the git master branch on 64-bit Linux.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:04:34.610Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":11,"reads":3,"readers_count":2,"score":55.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":978,"topic_slug":"invalid-dead-nodes-in-lua-causing-segfaults","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":231,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":5686,"name":"","username":"GoogleBot42","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/googlebot42/{size}/62_2.png","created_at":"2015-04-06T22:00:38.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eHmmm maybe there can be a wrapper class that internally keeps track if a pointer to an object is still valid.

If I store the node’s ID instead of a pointer, it cannot be deleted and cause a segfault. Then I can use scene_:GetNode(id) to retreive the pointer back when I need it. Hopefully the lookup performance will be acceptable. The only drawback to this is that the node ID might get reused (what is the probability of that happening? It never happened in the test script). To detect that, I could add some kind of “version” number on the node, e.g.:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"lang-auto\"\u003enode.version = global_version_number\nglobal_version_number = global_version_number + 1\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen when I access it, check for a) the existence of .version, and b) if it matches the value stored with the ID.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoogleBot, your metatable idea would make a nice way to tidy all this up!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis might work, but it would be nice to do it the “right” way.

I don’t think there is any easier way for you to safely get hold of a child node in this particular case because there is no way you can increase its reference count in Lua at the moment (until someone refactor our current Lua/C++ binding to move away from tolua++). If you really need the node object again after it has been “removed” from the scene then perhaps you can workaround the problem currently by simply not calling node:Remove() method, but instead by calling node:SetParent(deadNodeRoot) where deadNodeRoot is the parent of all dead node. … \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI only want to use the node if it is still valid.
