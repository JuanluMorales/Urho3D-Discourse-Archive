Does Urho3D support Pose animation like Ogre (VAT_POSE)?

I don't know the answer, but...

Yes poses are covered as vertex tweening, or morph shapes, but are not well supported
There is a concept that you provide a bind pose, at least.
There are issues with the animation blending that need addressing too, but you can mostly get by.
If you have any specific requests for features, I am listening!
