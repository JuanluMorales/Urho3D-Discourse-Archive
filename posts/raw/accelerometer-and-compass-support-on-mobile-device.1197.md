Please add accelerometer and compass support on mobile devices.

Welcome. Input features by large depend on the SDL library. I don't know about compass but accelerometer should appear, at least on Android, as a "virtual" joystick.

I want to make games use Urho3D on mobile devices(android and ios),but i found that it looks like more hard than on a specific platform(for example on pc).
Anyway,Urho3d is a great engine, thanks for your contribution!
