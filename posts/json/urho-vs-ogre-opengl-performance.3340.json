Before the latest 2.x adventure. And from what I could grasp, Ogre3D was nice for hello-world applications but as soon as you began to scale a bit, you would’ve hit the issues of an old game engine design. And not to mention that Ogre3D is just a rendering engine. And while people call it a game engine, I fail to see all the components of a game-engine without third-party (\u003cem\u003epossibly outdated/maintained or soon to be\u003c/em\u003e) libraries. And the worst of all, most of those third-party libraries are likely to each use a different design and you’ll have to deal with integrating them into your game and adjust your style to each. Unless you’re a good game-developer or part of team of good game-developers (\u003cem\u003eand I mean really good\u003c/em\u003e). The best you can do with the engine are hello-world games, or simple games that look like they were taken from the 10’th place of a game-jam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompiling Ogre3D is(was?) another fun story. I don’t know how that goes lately but I remember it being a bit daunting for anyone new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd to be honest, I don’t even know what critical part of OpenGL 4.5 is Ogre3D using. Most likely for some fancy feature that you’re not even using. Like tessellation and whatnot. Basically, that number slapped on the engine is more like “\u003cem\u003ehey, you can use this version of open GL if you want or need (\u0026lt;- probably not)\u003c/em\u003e”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow let’s bring up the rude/unfiltered part of me: If you couldn’t be arsed to try out the engine and judge for yourself whether it would be sufficient for your needs. I highly doubt you’ll be able to move forward with your project other than making these topics (\u003cem\u003ewith either engine\u003c/em\u003e). And most importantly: This is not the bottleneck you’re looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not a game-dev, or consider myself as one, but I see these kind of topics online all the time.
