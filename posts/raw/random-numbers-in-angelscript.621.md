I have been looking for a function to generate random numbers in AngelScript, but I cant find one. I have tried random (with one and two parameters), brandom, rand, everything I found in google, but nothing works. The random function was supposed to be [url=http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/sdk/docs/manual/doc_addon_math.html]here[/url], but seems that it was removed or something. Any idea?

Doesn't Urho already expose its Math::Random() method to scripting?

Excellent, I thought the language had its own native function (Lua does).
