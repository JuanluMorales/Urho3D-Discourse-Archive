Just another work in progress glsl shader that I'm working on while learning how Urho shader works...  :slight_smile:

cool) but you probably need also add caustics effect for underwater land and objects for more realistically underwater world.

see this blender example: [rghost.ru/7WyKYrf9z](http://rghost.ru/7WyKYrf9z)  (first big grey button - "???????")
there a lot glsl shaders for water effects, probably they maybe ported into urho

Thanks and yes I agree. I will post source soon and maybe the water shader example can be completed. :slight_smile:

I'm also interested in this.

Hey guys, already updated with the code.  :smiley:

This one looks pretty cool. I think having couple particle emitters to shoot bubbles  could work really well in there.

Thanks Tikari. Yes and some other effects as well.   :slight_smile:
