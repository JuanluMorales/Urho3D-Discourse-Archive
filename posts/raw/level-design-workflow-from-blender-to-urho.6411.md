Just wanted to share my workflow here, since it might help others. Feel free to share yours too, so other newbies can have some direction on how to start. 

1) Blocking out: I use https://blender-addons.org/qblocker-addon/ 
2) Detailing: https://gumroad.com/l/VthLyO and custom static meshes (that I manage with https://blendermarket.com/products/asset-management/)
3) Texturing/Lighting: I just randomly slap materials to my surfaces, and then I use https://blendermarket.com/products/baketool to create a single texture out of my entire map. Then I use https://github.com/Naxela/The_Lightmapper to create the lightmap for it. Using GIMP, I blend the two textures and I get some pretty nice shadows.
