This is a known problem that is specific to the CMake/Visual Studio generators. Unlike other generators where you can change the already configured/generated build tree from 32-bit to 64-bit and vice versa, the VS generators come in two different flavors: ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù and ‚ÄúWin64‚Äù that once the build tree has been generated with one of these, it must stay to use the initially configured 32-bit or 64-bit (not changeable).
