If the engine can kinda do what other modern engines can do (in the result, like: effects (PBR,\u2026), physic,\u2026) and if it fits the needs of the people who want to use it, I don\u2019t think they have a real demand for new stuff. If there\u2019s really some professional team with special needs like a better, specialized level editor for their dedicated level designers, they may create their own tool anyway.<br>\nIf a more or less novice comes in (after searching for \u201cgame engine\u201d or whatever) and wants for example make something like \u201cMario Kart\u201d, he looks at samples, starts with playing with some of them or starts modifying the closest one to his goal. He reads available documentation \u201cah I can use Blender and the exporter to make car models\u201d, \u201cah that\u2019s how I can import that and attach physical wheels with physic constraints\u201d,\u2026 I don\u2019t think his main concern is getting regularly new features, unless he really needs something or something is bugged.<br>\nAlso I mentioned my sample projects idea already: having small games in various genres would make an entry way easier and would hugely boost the \u201cfame\u201d/community. \u201cUrho Tournament\u201d? \u201cUrho Commander\u201d? \u201cAge of Urho\u201d? \u201cUrho Cart\u201d? \u201cSuper Urho Maker\u201d? <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=10\" title=\":smiley:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":smiley:\"></p>\n<p>[quote=\u201ccadaver\u201d]<br>\nFor the \u201croadmap\u201d thing, yes it could easily become outdated or too optimistic and therefore be \u201cfake\u201d like you say, whereas the Github issue tracker (mostly) reflects the reality of development.

The CMake scripts can already pretty easily build on all platforms. A project could use Git hooks or Cron jobs to trigger an automatic build process (on possible different machines/platforms) that builds the application for multiple targets, builds setups or whatever and uploads that as a snapshot (or whatever) to a website.

Just taking something free and selling it is really cheesy. They seem to have added a lot though and their price isn\u2019t that high (that\u2019s the reason I decided to not comment on it after wanting at first) but it still feels unfair. Apple and Microsoft and other did similar things: taking stuff from BSD for example and making it commercial. (These two have changed though a bit in the last years and are contributing in various big free software projects now.)</p>\n<p>General thoughts unrelated to this case:<br>\nI thought a lot about this \u201cmoral stealing\u201d and how to avoid such a thing via a license (which is the only thing one can do) since learning about the free software idea many years ago. The license could require commercial projects to give back a certain amount (money or code) in relation to how much work they added and money they earned.</p>\n<p>Somewhere I also mentioned that I see it as a moral obligation to (somehow) contribute back to free software if you benefit from it (by making money from it or just using it). Such a moral obligation does not just concern software though but all parts of live. Most people don\u2019t contribute back though. (this \u201ccontributing back\u201d doesn\u2019t have to be towards exactly the software one uses IMHO, that software may be doing fine and other good project may need the help more)</p>\n<p>This \u201cmoral stealing\u201d is the reason some projects make a dual license: GPL or commercial license (for a price).<br>\nThe basic idea behind copyleft licenses is to require that the software stays free. It emerged from exactly this: companies taking free software, making it proprietary (and commercial) and earning money by doing that.<br>\nDemanding a fair profit share is a similar idea. Though copyleft is often seen as non-commercial so a profit-share demand would, in the eyes of some, seem contrary to the free software ideal. Though copyleft too is often seen as contrary to \u201creal free software\u201d (BSD-, MIT- style license).</p>\n<p>Big philosophical topic.</p>\n<p>Edit: added a note and slightly changed the wording in the first part to make stuff clearer.

Despite the editor not being part of the repo yet it\u2019s on the roadmap currently I want to improve the renderer to more modern standards, changes like the rendering that fit in with Urhos targets will get PR\u2019s to the master. As for the website that was linked the information there is not correct, the web developer use placeholders and never finished. I do not intend to sell any part of the engine, although I have considered selling themed starter packs to build things like a Sci-Fi game, to be clear this does not mean example and tutorial projects. Any money I gain from the project will be put into Urho3D in some form, but I believe this is a long way off.</p>\n<p>If there comes a point where the Urho developers want to streamline the workflow I am happy to drop Clockwork In order to merge all changes to the master and then focus my effort on Urho alone. When i first started I considered doing all my chances to Urho3D but believed it was to big of a change from the current engine goals.[/quote]</p>\n<p>Ah, that makes things a lot clearer.

Of the alternatives, technically speaking LGPL is nasty on platforms where you can\u2019t reasonably allow the user to actually replace / update the library. Then there are other licenses such as EPL which to my understanding have the clause to give back contributions, but don\u2019t have the static / dynamic linking hassle. But all in all I believe MIT is still the right choice for its simplicity and permissiveness, as I\u2019d consider it a greater loss if someone could not use Urho in their scenario because of the license, compared to the risk of being commercially extended without contribution back.

A lot of the LGPL \u201cminefield-ness\u201d comes from such things. Especially with header only libraries, what is that?

Some of that code is now in the Urho3D repo, however pulled from Atomic and committed by someone else, which I have no problem with and gave permission.  Atomic is also raising a significant amount of awareness in the Urho3D project, for example I personally told <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/migueldeicaza\">@migueldeicaza</a> from Xamarin about Urho3D after he contacted us about Atomic, Urho3D was a better fit for their purposes and led to UrhoSharp\u2026 and now they were acquired by Microsoft.

This game to mind as i remember somewhere Cadaver mentioned something along the lines of if a user does not understand the engine it may not be the right engine for them, my idea is to provide a version of Urho that is more beginner friendly. I would be willing develop Clockwork as Urho [fill in gap] but only if this is something Cadaver is happy with.

With \u201cwhole work\u201d I also meant all the stuff Urho uses, I intentionally didn\u2019t name Urho.<br>\nIt just would be immoral to make code (found with a free license) proprietary, make a lot of cash, and not give back in any way.<br>\nAgain everything more meant in the stereotypical \u201cgreedy taking\u201d case which this case doesn\u2019t fit.</p>\n<p>Also making commercial offers around free software (like support, bundling, maintenance, service, teaching, adaption or whatever) is not immoral at all. Moral wise seen (IMHO) everything as long as the \u201cearning\u201d or \u201cprofit\u201d taken out of free software is in a fair ratio to the contribution back, which can be in many forms like code, money or whatever. That\u2019s kinda the same as with commercial software where you pay for using the software as well. Commercial licenses say \u201cgive us money for using our software\u201d, copyleft licenses say \u201cgive back (or \u201cpass on\u201d) the code of the software and your changes\u201d. BSD-/MIT-Style don\u2019t require anything, but I still see it as a moral obligation to \u201cgive back a fair amount in some way if possible\u201d. General \u201cfairness\u201d.</p>\n<p>About the \u201ccreating a side version\u201d idea:<br>\nThat requires continuous additional work (syncing) and would split communities. It would be better to work together on the same system as far as possible. Making Urho more beginner friendly is the goal of many and is in itself not contrary to any of Urho\u2019s design decisions.<br>\nIs there anything where a split would be required due to wanting conflicting things? Could these differences be resolved with some kind of option like the LUA safe vs. performance option?</p>\n<p>[quote]<br>\nIll give you a list of features i plan going forward:<br>\n\u2026<br>\nDo you feel these features are all acceptable for Urho main[/quote]<br>\nSounds good, acceptable and not conflicting to me.</p>\n<p>You could also do additional commercial tools like the editor(s) you mentioned. I personally wouldn\u2019t pay for that though, I would try making a free alternative if I really have a need but you could try your luck of course.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m thinking of your concern regarding needing a way to make money in some way:<br>\nThe thing I see as the most obvious way is making games and contribute back to code used (this is not a suggestion, just \u201can obvious way\u201d). Same as making any commercial software and contributing back to free stuff used like libraries or tools. Making money with libraries/engines or software developer tools is kinda hard I think as the target market is quite small and the price really sensitive and many developers try to fill the needs of developers.<br>\nThere is for example the commercial \u201cSpeedTree\u201d library for vegetation (there is also a wrapper for Ogre for example) which is a product for developer, but I don\u2019t know how good the profit is. Also there are already way more powerful engines like Unreal or CryEngine which have quite an unbeatable offers of price vs. benefit. Trying to compete with those is pretty impossible with a small team and undercutting the price is not really possible (at least Unreal and Unity are really cheap if I remember correctly, no idea about CryEngine).<br>\nUnless you find some kind of niece or area where your engine is better or you score in other ways, I don\u2019t see a big hope as there are already many affordable commercial engines. I mean you could try but I would try finding a better looking business model. Though I may also misjudge the market completely, I\u2019m not in the area of commercial engines or commercial game development.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m for example working in the area of image editing software and the photography area has a lot of really special needs and there are often not that many products available. Some areas have like 2-3 bad tools and everyone tries to find a better tool, that\u2019s where we try to come in and try to fill that gap with a better product, or making a completely new product.<br>\nMany areas in all the industries / business areas have special needs. The difficult thing is finding those as one has to know the area. And because software developer know their own area, that area is pretty over saturated. In other areas many people spend hours doing stuff that can be avoided or speed up or automated with software tools or simple devices and they would even pay thousands of dollars for a single (software) tool (\u201csolution\u201d) as it may safe them hundreds of hours of work per year which logically pays of for them. Many people also don\u2019t even know what they want but if they see a tool they are like \u201coh with that my work/life gets so much easier! I can haz?!\u201d <img src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\"> <a href=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2614/3880106888_581e6ee91b.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">c1.staticflickr.com/3/2614/3880 \u2026 6ee91b.jpg</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/c3/91/f0/c391f010ab9f54e2bf82389993f8e091.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/73 \u2026 f8e091.jpg</a></p>\n<p>TL:DR: I\u2019m skeptical of your commercial idea and you may have already felt that lack of demand.
