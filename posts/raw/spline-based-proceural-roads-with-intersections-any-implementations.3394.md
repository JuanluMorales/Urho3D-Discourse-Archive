Hi, all!

Is there some tutorial/guide on how to implement spline-based procedural roads with intersections?

Every other engine does have these, so I wonder where I could find some for Urho, or is there some
people who know how o do this?

I need uniform intersections (so intersecting splines should produce intersection). I made my own solution,
but it is too hacky, complex and slow. Any pointers?
