Can you provide steps to reproduce on Windows 7 or newer?

I have one ancient XP machine I'll be able to test in some time, but not immediately.

To reproduce you need only:

Startup options -w -s

Change the focus to another window.
Then click on the Title of Urho window.
You can move or resize it.
And press in the user area of Urho window.

--------------------------------------------------
If I miss a step "click on the Title" (just click to user area)
All works fine.
