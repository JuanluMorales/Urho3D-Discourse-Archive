I've been using Greg Zaal's free HDRIs from over at **[HDRI Haven](https://hdrihaven.com)** for a while now. But I just found out he's running a quite successful [Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/hdrihaven) _and_ is giving away ([CC0](https://hdrihaven.com/p/license.php)) his entire collection of 16k HDRIs!
Great for backgrounds and PBR.

Read about the change [here](https://blog.hdrihaven.com/2017/10/01/why-the-change/).

Some previews (these are not HDR images)

Do you have a sample setup of their HDR in Urho scenes?

Nope, I rendered one to a cubemap in Blender to use in [Quatter](https://luckeyproductions.itch.io/quatter). The other times I used HDRIs was also in Blender.
If anyone does create or find a setup like this, please _do_ share.

Perhaps a place to start and we're welcomed to contribute.

Like the Urho PBR sample scene, uses cubemap textures (output_pmrem_posx.dds etc) generated (coincidentally using CMFT) from an HDRI.
