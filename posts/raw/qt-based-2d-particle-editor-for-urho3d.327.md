A guy (xujingsy) and me have wrote a Qt based 2D particle editor for Urho3D.

Wow ! This is extremely cool  :astonished: 

And it's working quite well on my first try  :smiley:

This is really nice!  It is also really cruel because it teases me in thinking I could make something cool looking.

A great addition to Urho2D toolset, many thanks Aster  :stuck_out_tongue: 
I especially like QDarkStyle.

Fantastic work, Aster!

It works like a charm. I had to download Visual Studio 2012 redistributable from [microsoft.com/en-US/download ... x?id=30679](http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=30679) to make it work, though.
I've always wondered how Urho3D would fit within Qt, and it seems it does perfectly.

The code is clean and very understandable. Very  good work.
