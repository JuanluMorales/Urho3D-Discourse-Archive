Hello
Im learning Urho3D and started to use its own container classes like PODVector, Vector, etc in my data types. Before, i was using std, and when debugging QtCreator could display values inside them.

As far i know, GDB can understand user defined types using Python scripting. There is an existing implementation for Urho containers, or another way to inspect these at runtime?
Thanks
