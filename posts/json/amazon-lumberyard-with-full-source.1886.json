I think though you’d really need to rewrite some reliant middleware, or perhaps adapt it to this system somehow. I think for any codebase, starting with Urho3D’s core \u0026amp; build system would be a very wise decision. I think also decoupling the development pipeline and the runtime as another cool way to go, like just doing XML stuff in the development phase and then transforming this to a binary format which is just directly mapped to a struct.
