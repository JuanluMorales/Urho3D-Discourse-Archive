Can somebody explain me if there is some advantage in using one of those methods, instead of the others? So far the only one I can notice is that with spawn, I can click and create an object in the place I want (or quite close), while paste places the object on top of the original one. In terms of graphic perfomance, are they the same?

i'm use copy&paste method )
but there one bug i guess. 
then you copy some child node and then do paste it in sameplace(parent node) it pasted in global scene not in own parent node.
then i move with mouse the copied node to his parent again.
