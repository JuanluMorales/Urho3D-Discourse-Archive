After spending a lot of time trying to figure out why my touch events stopped working on iOS after I upgraded from Urho3D 1.5 to Urho3D 1.8 alpha, I found out that is was related to my code being setup to run on both desktop and touch platforms. Apparently in SDL2.0.4, iOS (and presumably Android), generate mouse messages for touch events by default (I don’t think that was true in the earlier version of SDL that Urho3D 1.5 used). In my application, I run the same code on Windows and iOS, so I had both mouse and touch event handlers, and they started both getting called on iOS, which caused a lot of bad behavior.
