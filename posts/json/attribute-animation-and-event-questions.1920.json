It ends up converted to StringHash. Would it not be better to allow string types so they have more meaningful names? I could make PR changing it to string, but it is not backwards-compatible so need developer blessing on this one. Ofc it can be made backwards-compatible with ugly hack of converting numeric strings to integers before generating StringHash but its ugly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQ2: Can we modify scene graph from “eventframe” event?

If the event sender is not important, you can just add an object that stores the events in a map\u0026lt;EventType, multimap\u0026lt;EventType, VariantMap\u0026gt;\u0026gt; and have it subscribe to the first event type, and when it receives that event send all of the events in the second container (a multimap is probably not the best solution – perhaps a vector of pairs or something instead). If caller is important, you then need to store the caller as well, and ensure that the caller either still exists (i.e. store in SharedPtr\u0026lt;\u0026gt;) or handle the case that the caller is deleted. You then just have a QueueEvent(EventType sendon, EventType willSend, VariantMap data) that adds it to that container and subscribes to the sendon events, with a generic handler that will empty the map of those events, sending all of them with their willSend types, and unsubscribing from that eventtype.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs to Q2, the crashing is probably because you are removing the node that is in the middle of updating it’s attribute animations, and removing it probably releases the last reference, causing it to be deleted while it is still executing a function (that later does stuff with this, which has been deleted). My suggestion would be to mark the object with a remove flag, and on the update event remove it. Alternatively, consider adding specific object that simply deletes all of it’s children during the update event, and reparent the object to that node instead of removing it directly. As far as I know modifying the scene graph is allowed at this time. You simply aren’t allowed to delete the object that is updating it’s animations and causing that event to be called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding Q1, I assume it’s for efficiency reasons involved in the size of StringHash vs String, and, more importantly, in the equality comparisons, though I’m not a developer and I’m not at all certain.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":3,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:11:31.889Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":9,"reads":32,"readers_count":31,"score":51.4,"yours":false,"topic_id":1920,"topic_slug":"attribute-animation-and-event-questions","display_username":"Sir Nate","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":242,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":11413,"name":"","username":"rku","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/rku/{size}/3200_2.png","created_at":"2016-03-27T08:29:04.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThanks for clarifications Nate.
