Super trivial addition for specifying BLOb files in attributes/scripts/resource-cache. I only use it for specifying binary scene files that get used to instantiate nodes at the present (ie. `Bytes@ projectileDetonation; Bytes@ hardDeathGibs;` etc). 

Simple thing for a simple job: give me blobs and let the resource-cache deal with them.
