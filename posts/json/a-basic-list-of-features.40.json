(I`m using angel script cause I like the c++ like syntax)\n    you can handle any event in your script code,  engine code is always engine code, script code will do the logic and game event handling.\n    register your custom function is very easy.\n\n5. data driven render path.\n    customize your render style but not modify the source code.\n\n   All the features makes easy prototype and quick iteration. \n\n   Things I don`t like?\n       too much memory allocation and deallocation every frame.\n\n       every time construct and destruct a variantmap will do system malloc and free like: \n\n       VariantMap eventData;\n       //.....\n      SendEvent(xx, eventData);  \n      \n      in this case eventData`s lifetime is every short, I ended up with a walk around that, make eventData static like this\n      static VariantMap eventData;\n      //......\n      SendEvent(xx, eventData);\n\n     maybe a frame allocator or statck allocator is the best in this case.\n\n     Too much string used( this also makes memory allocation too much), most cases string hash is good enough for for addressing or compare.\n     But it`s not friendly for editor or debugging, so in my case, I add a global HashMap\u0026lt;StringHash, const char*\u0026gt;
