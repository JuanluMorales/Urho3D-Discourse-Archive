I created a simple room mesh in blender with different materials (each having it’s own texture) for the walls, floor, and ceiling. I’m using the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/reattiva/Urho3D-Blender\" data-bbcode=\"true\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eUrho3D-Blender Exporter\u003c/a\u003e to export and generate an .mdl for the room’s mesh, and it generates materials and textures for the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I only use one I can get the material/texture to work. If I use more than one, only material is visible (the ceiling) and the rest of the mesh is the blank default material. Not sure what I’m doing wrong. Or if I’m making an incorrect assumption in thinking a single .mdl can have multiple materials.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:05:57.273Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":24,"reads":11,"readers_count":10,"score":122.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":1185,"topic_slug":"how-to-have-multiple-materials-on-single-mesh","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://github.com/reattiva/Urho3D-Blender","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"GitHub - reattiva/Urho3D-Blender: Blender to Urho3D mesh exporter","clicks":1}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":193,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":6774,"name":"","username":"JulyForToday","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/j/a9a28c/{size}.png","created_at":"2015-07-15T04:56:22.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eAh, I attempted to do as you asked, and I found the problem: the attribute inspector was too small, and only the first material was visible.
