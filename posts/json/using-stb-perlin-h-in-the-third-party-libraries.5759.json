As to why, including it in the header \u003cem\u003ewith the define\u003c/em\u003e told the library to include the implementation of the (not inline) functions at that point. Having that header then included in multiple cpp files resulted in multiple definitions/implementations of the same function. When compiled there where then multiple object files that contained the function, and then when the object files were linked into an executable the linker saw that there were multiple copies of _stb_perlin_noise3, for example, and since it can’t tell which of them is the correct one it produces an error (you could, for instance, have multiple different functions with the same name but different effects. I’m guessing you can see why that would be problematic in linking the executable.
