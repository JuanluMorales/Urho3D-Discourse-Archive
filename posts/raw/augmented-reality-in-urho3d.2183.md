Does Urho3D support augmented reality? Can I use my device camera as texture source?

You will need OpenCV link it with your Urho3D project and render to texture inside your application.

That's great! I'm using OpenCV. Could you please point out to a tutorial or a piece of code for doing this?

Try this (no, I've never done it, but this seems to be what you want): [url]http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/34472/Video-Texture-in-OpenGL[/url]
