Systemin in sence that they work from any open game situation. Character should be able to open door. Basically if there is a door close enough (i,e, up to 10m to a door), character should get to that door, then get to one of appropriate locations, then open it. There are 2 situations - normal door and vehicle door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo basically, we can split this into 3 phases - approach a door, ???. open door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe actual door open animation is quite simple - it just swings or slides. The problem is animating actual character model. I’m too lazy (or failed as animator) to create every possible animation for this. So I want procedural approach. Is there existing papers, vidoes, any information about creating such interactions? I have no mocap access though,\u003cbr\u003e\nso I still need to animate…\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/Sinoid\"\u003e@Sinoid\u003c/a\u003e please heeeelp!\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2018-02-22T19:01:07.202Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":19,"reads":35,"readers_count":34,"score":102.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":4038,"topic_slug":"animation-of-character-openning-a-door","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":2,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":554,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":23395,"name":"Jonathan","username":"Sinoid","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/f19dbf/{size}.png","created_at":"2018-02-22T23:03:21.518Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eI’ve got nothing for this.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2018-02-22T23:03:21.518Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":0,"reads":31,"readers_count":30,"score":21.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":4038,"topic_slug":"animation-of-character-openning-a-door","display_username":"Jonathan","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[{"id":2,"count":1}],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":669,"hidden":false,"trust_level":2,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":23396,"name":"SirNate0","username":"SirNate0","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/9f8e36/{size}.png","created_at":"2018-02-23T00:38:34.720Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eJust throwing it out there, but depending on how realistic it must be you could try just using IK and attaching the hand to the knob/handle for some portion of the door opening animation.
