Hi guys,
I noticed a weird behaviour with Random() and SetRandomSeed() it might be a broken build or something as mine is not up to date.
When I call SetRandomSeed(Time::GetSystemTime()) I am not getting random numbers with Random() instead they are always the same. If I call just Random() I am getting random numbers. It looks like the behaviour is reveresed.
