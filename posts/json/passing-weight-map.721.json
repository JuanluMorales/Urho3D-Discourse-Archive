If you assign, say, dirt to (0,0.3), grass to (0.3,0.6) and stone to (0.6,1) then it becomes impossible to have a smooth blend directly from dirt to stone, because any interpolation between dirt and stone is going to cross over grass territory, resulting in a narrow band of grass-ish blend in-between. Using a weighted blend, you can easily blend between dirt ® and stone (B) simply by using 0 for the grass (G) color component. IMO, thresholds are only suitable for those myriad terrain “demos” you see all over youtube, and any “serious” terrain implementation is going to implement full blending or splatting. Because, really, how often in real life do you see terrain determined solely by elevation above sea level? Never, that’s how often.
