I’m using a physics-based character controller, and the characters are now jumping about half as high as before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI use \u003ccode\u003ebody-\u0026gt;ApplyImpulse(Vector3::UP * JUMP_FORCE);\u003c/code\u003e to jump, which I believe is the same approach taken by Sample 18_CharacterDemo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny idea what could be causing this change in behavior?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEdit:\u003c/strong\u003e After further investigation, it seems to be a difference in how gravity works.
