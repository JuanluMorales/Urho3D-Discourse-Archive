The Ninja Snow War example seems to be the de-facto standard example of networking in the Urho engine. Unfortunately, it lacks focus on the networking capabilities themselves. There are many questions left hanging:

* Is P2P networking with master server possible?
* How would a dedicated server work?
* NAT Punching?
* Compression?
* Client-side prediction / slerp?
* Maximum amount of players?
