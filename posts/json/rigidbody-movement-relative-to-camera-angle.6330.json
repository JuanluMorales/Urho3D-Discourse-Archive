So far, I can make the player character move just fine using RigidBody and ApplyImpulse, and I can also make camera orbit around the player. However, I’m struggling with making the character’s movement follow the angle of the camera. I want to move in the direction of the camera by pressing forward (W), move in a direction 90° to the right of wherever the camera’s pointing when I press right (D), move directly towards the camera by pressing back (S) and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor reference, \u003ca href=\"https://pastebin.com/xqUvQzcp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ehere’s a pastebin with all the code I have so far\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorry if this is too obvious of a thing to ask about - as you may be able to tell from my code, I’m an absolute beginner \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=9\" title=\":smiley:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":smiley:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2020-08-17T06:31:50.243Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":75,"reads":25,"readers_count":24,"score":380.0,"yours":false,"topic_id":6330,"topic_slug":"rigidbody-movement-relative-to-camera-angle","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"link_counts":[{"url":"https://pastebin.com/xqUvQzcp","internal":false,"reflection":false,"title":"#include \u003cstring\u003e#include \u003csstream\u003e#include \u003cUrho3D/Core/CoreEvents.h\u003e#i - Pastebin.com","clicks":2}],"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":1370,"hidden":false,"trust_level":0,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":38702,"name":"","username":"Lys0gen","avatar_template":"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/l/57b2e6/{size}.png","created_at":"2020-08-17T14:51:35.415Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eInstead of moving along the fixed world axes you should take the rotation of the camera node into account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheck out example 18 (Character Demo), if I have understood you correctly it should do exactly what you want to achieve (except maybe locking the character to the camera.
