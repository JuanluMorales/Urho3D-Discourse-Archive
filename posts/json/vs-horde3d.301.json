Indeed Horde3D is very nice and it’s ideal to use as a drop-in library for rendering and it has an easy to use C-API inspired by OpenGL itself, very polished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Horde3D lacks is a robust multi-threaded octree scenegraph and culling system which Urho3D has, it does use GPU occlusion queries while Urho3D favours a CPU occlusion query approach which both have their strengths and weaknesses. Also Urho3D can do instancing while Horde3D does not. I think also blendshape and cpu skinning is multi-threaded in Urho3D as well while Horde3D is single-threaded. Also the licensing is a lot more liberal in Urho3D (MIT) than Horde3D (EPL). Both have a very similar data-driven approach to building shaders/materials, and you can both build your own renderer paths from data too, that can do forward lighting/deferred shading, however deferred lighting (pre-pass) I don’t think was standard in Horde3D.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably the most important thing to note is that the main developers of Horde3D don’t work on it any more, it is only the community which maintains it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArguably Urho3D is quite modular so if you don’t need the engine itself you can compile the Renderer part and use the Renderer.h in your own engine and get a perfectly abstracted OpenGL2.0+extensions/Direct3D9 renderer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheers\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":2,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T00:59:30.604Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":1,"reads":11,"readers_count":10,"score":7.2,"yours":false,"topic_id":301,"topic_slug":"vs-horde3d","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":69,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":1642,"name":"Lasse
