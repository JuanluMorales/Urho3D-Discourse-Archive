E.g. I thought that cGBufferInvSize was something that I could use for this but it doesn’t seem to give me the right results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the proper way to do it is to change the value manually from the game code, I would like to know if there is a resize event that I can subscribe to, to do so ?\u003cbr\u003e\nCurrently I know how to set the proper size at startup and how to update it each frame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce that stuff works properly, I may have something to show you that may or may not be useful for other Urho3D users  :mrgreen:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePS:\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks for creating such an awesome open source engine  \u003cimg src=\"https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s really the only engine (that’s not dead) I found that offers all of the basic features I expect to need while still being simple to use and understand due to its clean source code and decent documentation.\u003cbr\u003e\nBeing able to develop an application in C++ using the tools that the engine offers in a relatively straightforward manner is something that I have been searching a long time for.\u003cbr\u003e\nMost engines either don’t have enough features, are complicated to use, or make you modify a “template game” in a scripting language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo keep going !

You can inverse that further if you need the actual size. Note that if you have a viewport that’s smaller than window, it’s not giving the whole window size, but only the viewport, as you’ll never be sampling the actual backbuffer, but a viewport-sized copy of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you need the window size for? If you need to sample the viewport texture eg. for postprocessing see the shader function GetScreenPos() or GetScreenPosPrediv() for getting the UV coordinates in the vertex shader. For a simple example, see the greyscale postprocess shader (Bin/CoreData/Shaders/HLSL/GreyScale.hlsl). For a more complicated example that uses the viewport inverse size to offset to adjacent pixel samples, see the FXAA shader (Bin/CoreData/Shaders/HLSL/EdgeFilter.hlsl)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to go the other route (manual uniform), the screen resize event is ScreenMode (E_SCREENMODE) defined in
