I've created 2D rendering of Doom 2 maps.  I am using Urho.Net and Wad extraction package from Managed Doom (explained in GitHub).

Eventually, I would like to recreate the Doom game in Urho.net.  This is my first attempt at reading the Wad file.

Cool project 
Looking at your repo links , I guess you will use [managed-doom](https://github.com/sinshu/managed-doom) as your reference .
I took a glance look at the  [managed-doom](https://github.com/sinshu/managed-doom) source code 
Basically managed-doom is using SFML as an abstraction layer , I guess you will replace it with Urho.net
Good luck , I have some beautiful memories of my childhood , the sleepless nights  playing it :)
