Since I have tried to make UI scale according to window size and the game is resizable, I haven‚Äôt found a way to set the UIElement size as size of the window. So when I am creating the ui-layouts with the editor, I have to manually always set the uielements size, so that I can actually use the horizontal/vertical alignment to correct side/corner of the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I resize the window size, I actually have to go through all the root elements to set the size of the elements according to the screen size. Now if there was a checkbox for use window screen width/height for uielement, this would actually make a lot of things easier for me, and hopefully for others too who are building UIs with urhos editor.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":1,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:07:39.536Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":0,"incoming_link_count":112,"reads":18,"readers_count":17,"score":563.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":1425,"topic_slug":"set-uielement-size-as-whole-game-window-size","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":205,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":8191,"name":"Lasse √ñ√∂rni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2015-10-14T14:26:45.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eTypically this is something you‚Äôd do in code when the game is running.

For example my ui might look as following during the game play: uiroot-\u0026gt;gameplayui-\u0026gt;dialogbox-\u0026gt;‚Ä¶\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess the only thing where this might be useful is things like dialogbox, where I would prefer to have full width sized dialogbox, and kinda trust on the automatic layout-engine to do its magic. Although even then I have to manually adjust some of the components.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is kind of same as with something that I have been cursing on the automatic layout-engine, which is automatically keep things as minimized size. Like for example lets say that I add some stuff on the ui, and the ui grows bigger (during game play), and after deleting something I have to manually set that uielements parent uielement size to 0,0 so that it would automatically resize its size to the minimum size. Maybe it could also be used with horizontal/vertical layoutmode to keep one component at its minimum size, instead of like dividing the whole element size / number of child elements. The minimum size on the other hand might be even more problematic with the use full window width as uielement width option.\u003c/p\u003e","post_number":3,"post_type":1,"updated_at":"2017-01-02T01:07:39.782Z","reply_count":0,"reply_to_post_number":null,"quote_count":1,"incoming_link_count":1,"reads":18,"readers_count":17,"score":8.6,"yours":false,"topic_id":1425,"topic_slug":"set-uielement-size-as-whole-game-window-size","display_username":"","primary_group_name":null,"flair_name":null,"flair_url":null,"flair_bg_color":null,"flair_color":null,"version":1,"can_edit":false,"can_delete":false,"can_recover":false,"can_wiki":false,"read":true,"user_title":null,"bookmarked":false,"actions_summary":[],"moderator":false,"admin":false,"staff":false,"user_id":205,"hidden":false,"trust_level":1,"deleted_at":null,"user_deleted":false,"edit_reason":null,"can_view_edit_history":true,"wiki":false,"can_accept_answer":false,"can_unaccept_answer":false,"accepted_answer":false},{"id":8196,"name":"Lasse √ñ√∂rni","username":"cadaver","avatar_template":"/user_avatar/discourse.urho3d.io/cadaver/{size}/3_2.png","created_at":"2015-10-14T16:10:51.000Z","cooked":"\u003cp\u003eThe layouting does somewhat evil things, as there are cases where it doesn‚Äôt actually respect the min/max size, unless the element is set to completely fixed size.
